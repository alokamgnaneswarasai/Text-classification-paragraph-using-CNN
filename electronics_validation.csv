5,"It's a great addition to my Xoom tablet. Works great so far and I haven't had any issues once I got it working. However, it took a bit of tweaking to get it working. It comes formatted exFAT which is not recognized by the Xoom. Attempting to format it as FAT32 on my Windows system failed so I tried it on my iMac. It worked just fine and once formatted I used Acronis True Image Home 2012 with the Plus Pack to clone my 32GB MicroSD card to the new 64GB card. All apps, and data transferred correctly (even apps installed on the SD card). Only time will tell how reliable this new technology is but I've always had good experiences with SANdisk in the past."
5,We needed something to Extend our tv away from the hot pipe for the winter and this wall mount did the trick. It went up with no a problems. It worked out very well!
3,"This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+)."
4,"The wall mount installed easily and works smoothly.  The only downside is adjusting the up and down tilt, you must loosen a bolt most of the way before you can muscle the TV into a different position."
1,"I checked around Amazon as well as some other sites, and decided these were what I needed.  I read the reviews, looked at the pictures and bought two of these.  I received them today.  I unpacked one of them, read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for Amazon.  These mounts are very, very heavy and require 6, yes SIX, screws to mount to the wall.  Are you kidding me?  The TVs are only 22 lbs!  Two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary.  What a joke!  And Lag bolts?  Ever heard of screws?  The other issue is that these are very hard to move.  I bought an articulating wall mount for a reason, and I expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my hand."
5,"Just what the Nook Simple Touch ordered, bewarned though this is what you get just the plug no USB cable so if you need that also it'll be another purchase, appears to charge fine only had to use it a few times so it's still like brand new."
4,"Simple installation. Helpful to have a second set of hands at times, but could be done by yourself. Instructions aren't the greatest.  Holds a Toshiba 46"" LED in a corner perfectly. Feels sturdy.  I don't so much like the look of the plastic cover on the wall side of the arm."
5,"You know, it figures that the people who would be most prone to bash the Nook would either be predisposed to like its competition (most likely posting for Amazon incognito...), or are such techno-geeks that nothing EVER meets their impossible-to-meet criteria. They are quick to criticize, and slow to praise. I've read all the criticisms on here thus far and while some have a point, most are absolutely ridiculous or downright untruthful. One guy said he bought four Nooks for Christmas and three out of the four were either rendered inoperable or ceased to function altogether. Sounds like an Amazon-paid poster to me...fishy story.  Please know that I'm not partial to B&N. It's a bookstore. I have no loyalty to them as they have never put out an electronic product before. At the same time, I also own some Sony products and they continue to work either fine or great. I don't hate Amazon, nor the Kindle. In fact, I use Amazon for purchases frequently and I would have bought the Kindle if I was partial to it. Same goes for Sony. However, I did my own comparitive research on e-readers and concluded with the Nook being the best fit for me, my needs, and my expectations. All so far, have been met. Whatever the case with negative ""geek"" reviews, here's my take on the Nook:  - It's out-of-the-box easy and very intuitive. Mine came on Saturday, and by that evening I had: 1)set up my B&N account, 2)fully charged my unit, 3)connected to my in-home wireless network, 4)set to my personal preferences (complete with personalized wallpaper & screensavers), 5)downloaded some easy-listening music, 6)dragged over a PDF file from work, 7)and downloaded three books (2 purchased, 1 free) from the B&N link to enjoy. All this done before dinner... - The Eink display rules. I actually find it easier to read than an actual book, especially considering the fact that I am holding a digital unit near half the actual size of a tried-and-true book. It's light, sleek, slim, portable and cool. - While the touch screen is one way to go, it is not really necessary. And you really need to adjust the brightness on it pretty much from the get-go. It's like staring into headlights while trying to read. But once I did adjust the brightness as well as the touch screen timer (10 sec, 30 sec or 60 sec), it was actually a nice to have function. - After initially fully charging the unit, my Nook has lasted going-on 4 days now. Those who complain it doesn't last 10-12 days, while they are justified at being angry with B&N for ""false"" advertising, I still see no problem. I never read their claim for this sort of durability, thus, I'm not upset with having to charge my unit every 2-3 days. I see it the same as I see my cell phone or Ipod. And hopefully in the near future Powermat will come out with a Nook adapter... - SD Card option. Not necessary. But nice option to have. Already bought one. Already installed one. Easy cheesy...16GB...BAM!!! - Wi-Fi connectivity capability. I have a standard wireless router in my house. I was up & running in minutes. My first wi-fi purchase was Treasure Island for $.99 and then got a free copy of the Oxford Holy Bible. The B&N library is second-to-none when it comes to finding what you are looking for on e-book. - Bookmarks...I don't see the problem??? I haven't even upgraded my firmware yet, but every time I open up a book in My Library on my Nook, it goes directly to the page I last read. And this is done whether I leave a bookmark or not. It just does it...so what's everyone complaining about? I have 10 items in My Library so far and it does this for each item, except my PDF files from work. - Browser capability, or lack thereof...biggest dissappointment for me. If they could create a Netbook/E-Reader that was the size of an e-reader, but possessed the ""little PC"" functionality of a netbook, I would be in heaven. Until they do, I have both. Depending on the Kindle's capability, perhaps this is a strong seller for others out there. But for me, the Nook's other features outweighed not having a web browser capability.  Bottom Line: For me, I love it. Best little toy I've purchased in years. Do your own research, and pick the best e-reader for you. IMHO, I think it's great and it's only going to get better in the future. For $250, it's a great deal..."
4,"I have a very early model 42in flatscreen. The specs say the TV weighs in at 52lbs, i also have my soundbar mounted below the tv so thats another 5lbs or so on the mount. I'm pushing the limits of the mount with damn near 60lbs which the mount claims to support and so far it is. The arm does flex a good amount right at the middle connection but doesnt seem to be failing.  I have moved the arm in all positions, straight out, flat against wall and anywhere in between. Does have that ""flex"" to it but nothing has gotten worse over time so im confident that it is a sturdy product... just has me a little on edge because it looks unsafe however feels good.  Make sure to mount this into a stud in the wall... if your relying only on anchors/drywall and you have a heavy tv like me there is no way it will stay.  If it breaks ill let you guys know"
5,Bought this after trying a bargain priced sync cable.  I have had no issues with this cable or the wall adapter. It charges my Nook HD+ quickly and without having to jiggle the cable to get a connection.  Recommended.
5,Nice quality still works great... very happy with this purchase... need to add 10 more words.. so what can I say its a wall mount that I haven't had any problems with
5,"surprisingly good.  predictable HEA but with twists to get there.  like others have reviewed, one question remained un-answered which was disappointing, but it did not distract from the main story."
4,"I was a bit surprised that someone went to the trouble to put a book together for the MacBook.  Macs are designed to provide an intuitive user interface. I think I was right.  Most of the material is available for reference either on the Apple website or under the help menu. However, if you wish to have some ink on cellulose reading material to make you more comfortable as you try to figure out how to use or optimize your use of the MacBook, this is the book to get."
5,"I hung this in my house with great ease and it held up my 8 year old son because I wasn't going to put the 55"" flat screen on it to find out that it failed. Fully extends out 2 feet. This was worth the money."
5,I have had a few versions of the Nook E-Reader. I love this version of the e-reader. It has become my go to as far as a portable reader/tablet. I am a fan of the Nook E-Readers. I can do the same things on the Nook as I can on my laptop computer.
5,"I have a nexus 7, however I wanted a tablet just for my books and newspapers.  This is prefect for me.  For those who want to separate your reading from the other tech devices you have plus I made a investment in Barnes & Noble books and magazines.  This is the way to go."
5,"After reading many technical and customer reviews of both the Nook and the Kindle, I purchased the Nook.  I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user. Nook users also have a community forum they can join on the Barnes and Noble website to share ideas, tips, and news about the Nook. Also, improvements in the Nook software updates are due to customer input. I like for my suggestions to be heard and the Nook engineering team is listening. Don't take my word for it. Test drive the Nook for yourself before you make a decision."
5,"I love the Nook, so sad that they aren't doing well. I think the E-ink is great, I can't stand reading on my ipad, the blue light sucks. I think this glow is nice and soft enough to read before bed. The switching between pages does get a little jarring to most people. I got use to it."
5,"very very good value for this reader, and I am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away.  They immediately sent a replacement.  Immediately."
5,"I loved using this nook reader. The bottom touch screen made navigation very convenient, and the reading screen was also very nice. We are now switching to the all-new touch-screen nook that just came out. Yay! :)"
5,"I have a full 42"" HD flat screen mounted on this. Not only does everything look better than strapped to a table, but the adjustability makes this mount a pleasure to have.  It was simple to attach to the wall and has a small footprint, being a single stud wall mount.  The other major point of this mount is how many sized TV or monitors the mount can be adjusted to accept.  My TV mounts solidly and the mount itself is solid, yet adjusts with little effort.  This is just plainly a good and solid product that is well worth the money."
5,I waited until June 2010 until I bought a nook. So far I am loving it. I love the page turning swipe feature. Those that gave the nook 1 star are the ones who got theirs with the 1.1 firmware. The firmware is now up to 1.4 and the price has dropped to $199.
5,Easy to install. Works perfect for my 45 inch. Very sturdy. Love having the option to move the direction of my tv in my room. Wish I got this for my living room as well instead of the flat steady mount.
5,"Works just fine for LG G4. I think it should work well for other Androids too, don't know why not. USB Connection is standard Android.  I don't know if LG puts out a unique signal that requires this. If I get a chance to learn how it is with others, I may come back to this. Of course you need a standard HDMI cable to plug into it."
5,"I absolutely love it. While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of the other Ebook Readers, it does exactly what it is meant to do. It allows you to read books. I bought this as gateway into ebook technology and I love it. The unit fits into your hands nicely and is not heavy. The buttons on the side are helpful in turning the pages. It charges fast and the battery lasts a decent amount of time."
1,"Compared to mounts I have used on other display panels, this is very poor quality. Motion joints have unpredictable friction. Loosening or tightening joints is good for one or two motions, then they loosen more or become sticky. I would not mount a $600 display on such a poorly made mount. I have returned it to Amazon. Return process was very easy. High marks for that!"
5,I purchased this to install at my parents' house. The installation took less than half an hour and the TV feels secure. It wasn't a perfect fit for the TV but I was able to mix the included hardware to get it very close.
5,"Sometimes you never know when you are going to pickup a great read. I hadn't read anything before from author, Dale Roberts, but I certainly will be looking for his other books. It really was a ""Who Done It."" One of those books that I just couldn't put down. It reminded me a lot of Detective Alex Cross from the James Patterson series. If you like Alex Cross, you will enjoy reading about Detective Sgt. Alex Mendez. Enjoy this book, I did."
5,"Never met a book by J. R. Rain I did not Love! The uber cocky, uber endearing Knighthorse Is someone u want to know and befriend. The whole side story with him and ""God""  is a surprisingly funny,  thought provoking ongoing conversation,  that I hope continues.  Great read!!"
5,"Shipped promptly; exactly as advertised; well-made; perfect fit for our 32"" LED HDTV; REASONABLY PRICED!  Anyone who can locate a wall-stud, read a level (included, no less!), run a drill, and turn a wrench clockwise should consider this wall-mount solution."
5,"I received my purchase in perfect condition, The packaging was in great shape, and the product is brand new. You can tell that it is new because it is a bit stiff when you open it, as is any new book. Very happy with this product and would definitely buy again at this price."
5,"Very solid...we mounted our flat panel in the bedroom. Like the tipping feature and love the articulating feature. We checked prices at stores, big boxes, etc. best price of all including Costco..."
4,"It is a good value, but is not top notch quality. If you extend both arms in the same direction, the TV (30 inch) tilts. However if the arm goes right, then left, the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great."
5,i already have a nook color got it for mothers day nine years ago from what i have read the only difference is the nook hd has android on it which is why i will be buying it soon  my nook color i have had for nine years and is still going strong my only beef is on my nook color it only rotates when i'm reading and where u plug in charger is on the bottom  a bad place to put it does any one know where the charger port is at i hope not the bottom again it should be on the side of the tablet i'm just saying
5,"I've had it for about a month now, and I have already devoured 2 books on it. This is perfect for reading at the pool (the main reason I wanted it). It is also great for reading at night. I have had not issues with it at all. I use the SD card to manage all of my books which is handy. I bought a nice leather case from B&N (definitely much higher quality that some of the others I have seen.) If you need something to use on the go and in the sun (very important because there is no glass screen to give glare from hell) this is the choice for you. Another main reason that I bought this one is that I really don't care about FB or YouTube... I have a Galaxy S 3 for that ;)"
5,"I'm the kind of guy that wants something to function well and that's it.  This thing is brilliant at what it does: displays ebooks.  No frills, no apps, no video, no nonsense.  Because of this it makes it very easy to use.  Download Calibre for free and this baby syncs right up with it.  Battery lasts forever, and it has the same charger as most android smart phones, so In the mornings I take my smartphone off its charger and replace it with my little nook.  I am in the military and as someone else said, this fits perfect in the side cargo pocket of my ABU's.  I had the Kobo, which was a great reader, and my wife had the last nook which I didn't like because it was so damn heavy.  I bought this for me so I could give my Kobo to my little girl.  I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for $47!  This thing is really great.  The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed, but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.  Using this little beauty, and loading all of my own books, and PDF's that I have converted via Calibre, makes me beg the question: Why are people still buying Kindles?  I guess that is the same dilemma I have with Iphones.  Oh well, a fool and his money....  Buy this now!  You will not regret it!"
5,"Haven't had it but a few weeks, but I am learning how to download from the library, etc.  love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.  No operating problems so far.  Would recommend it for home or away"""
4,"Right now, I am standing and applauding Bethany House for finding such a jewel as Linda Nichols.  I believe Linda's grandmother and my grandmother were best friends, for she has captured the sights, sounds and smells of my girlhood between the pages of this book regarding the grandmother character.  The reader is caught up into the sphere of spiritual warfare from the very first page, and then reads how it all plays out in the earthly realm. I know I have read the first few pages of this before and I'm thinking it was a contest that Dave Long held on conversion experience. It was so gripping then that I remember it to this day.  This story is very unique and, yet, it is the oldest story since time began because we all get caught in Satan's web of seduction, we all think there is no way out, we all bargain with God at one time or another, we all get angry at circumstances and must fight to forgive our loved one's choices, and we all find out sooner or later that only God can cure all ills, heal all wounds and change all hearts... if we just allow Him the elbow room to do it.  This story is very well-woven. The characters are first rate developed and we see personalities clash in a most believable way. What I love most about this story is that every character grows, blossoms, and finds sure footing on their life path.  The main character, Bridie Collins, is worn out from the bad choices she has made. One day, she's had enough of buying ingredients for cooking meth and being the maid for two slothful drug dealers, so she bides her time until they both crash from too much of a bad thing. She steals the drug money and makes her getaway, calling a hot tip line to make sure that Jonah is arrested and put safely away so he won't come after her. The drug money is stolen so her plans for getting far, far away go awry. She settles in Virginia. Bridie is not her real name, it is her mother's. Somehow, taking on the name of her mother settles her spirit and infuses her soul with a modicum of peace. She is still running away from her bad choices and not facing the music, but we realize that she has some spiritual growing to do before that can happen. It may be the middle of winter, when snow swirling around, but what a garden grows in the little family that is blessed with her.  There are a couple of things that distract somewhat, and keep this story from being 5+ stars. When the paths of Bridie and Jonah part, we follow Bridie and then we're jerked from that story into the jail cell of Jonah. It does not lend to the storyline at all knowing what Jonah is thinking. The tension is better built with the fear from Bridie rather than Jonah's intentions. Also, there isn't a thing added to the storyline by knowing what Jonah's attorney is thinking or that she finally winds up out of the public defender's office and in the prosecutor's office. Those were major distractions.  In my opinion, it doesn't matter how excellently a story is written if we are led down dead end paths which do not include the protagonist. In crafting a believable story, the writer should understand that the reader feels cheated and bewildered when we don't know where we're going, there isn't any light at the end of the tunnel, and we're in the company of a character we do not know.  But don't let that keep you from buying this book for your Keeper Shelf. It is an extremely good character study of a pastor who is man-called, not God-called and of a woman who is coming to terms, with God's help, with her bad choices and how God works in our lives for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose. Excellent read. Time well spent."
5,"When I looked at the cover art, I decided this book was going to be a sweet little romance about a sweet young woman. What I got was a fantastic read filled with suspense that at times had my heart in my throat. I just couldn't put this book down!  The characters were well thought out and some were just so real, they made me think of people I knew in my own life travels. The story line, especially the main character's situation, was quite realistic.  I truly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it. This is geared more to the adult audience, as it contains the horrors of meth production and addiction."
5,"I purchased a Kindle for my wife last Christmas. She loves it and uses it more than any other gift I ever purchased her. She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasn't sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from B&N and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didn't experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery, it's nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. I'll probably never need it but it's also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.  The new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother. I have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device. I had no problems what-so-ever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me.  My wife still loves her Kindle but I think she is a little jealous. She asked me why I didn't get her a Nook for Christmas.  I was completely in the dark about ereaders until just 2 months ago. I know during my research I found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader I checked into. If you were putting off getting a Nook because of bad reviews, I would give them another look. There has been 2 firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns. That's not bad for a device that was only released a short while ago. I'm sure there will be further updates as time goes on and it will get only better.  ~eddie"
5,"Put the card in my phone, booted the phone up and formatted it.  It took a little while to format and didn't appear that it would work.  Then I noticed it said it was ""testing SDHC card"".  So I let the phone sit for about 10 minutes.  Sure enough it eventually mounted and was available to copy data.  Then I just copied the data from my old card to the new card and all is well."
5,"I absolutely love the Simple Touch Reader by Nook.  I love the battery life, the simplicity and the size of the device.  I can go for weeks without charging it, I can download books within seconds.  The best part is the size and weight of the device.  I can hold it for hours and read without getting hand cramps.  I also love the e-ink display so much more than a back lit screen.  I have an iPad mini, an ipad 4 and several other devices but none of them can hold a candle to the Nook Simple Touch Reader.  It irritates me that Barnes and Noble doesn't actively sell them because in my opinion it's the best e-reader available."
5,"Perfect cover for the nook HD+. Fits well, does its job, stays out of the way. Two distinctively different angles to prop up the tablet, and both are very right for different uses of the tablet. In fact, I realized that how good a tablet is liked depends so much on how easy it is use - propped up for reading, laid back for typing. And this cover/stand makes all the difference between using this old tablet easily, and using other, newer tablets without a well-designed stand."
5,"I got this for mounting a tv on the wall in my home office. Price was good and it worked. The adjustments on it work well, and it has a gizmo to hold the cables in place. Don't hesitate to buy. I think I am using this with a 38"" tv."
2,"I was not very impressed with these books, though I have enjoyed previous Heidi Betts novels. It's possible I just don't like a novella length romance - I do not read them often. Also, these three books (especially the first two) were more erotica than romance, which I was not expecting.  I feel like the focus was too much on sex and not enough on the characters and forging a romance. The sex scenes were very long and drawn out, and the characters spent very little time interacting with each other outside of the sex. I am not prudish - I like my romance novels to have sexy time in them - but this just felt like those porno movies that try to have a plot but really shouldn't bother because people only watch them for the sex. There wasn't a lot of plot or character depth here.  Also, I found Betts' vampires to be extremely boring. It's like True Blood vampires Disneyfied. Her vampires are out in the open publicly and drink synthetic blood called ""NuBlood"" (hmmmmm). Other than that, they don't act like vampires at all. I like my vampires to have a little bit of bloodlust, a little edge... Eric Northman is sexy, these vampires were just BLAH. I would have preferred them to not even BE vampires and the stories would probably have been much better.  I wouldn't really recommend this book - her knitting romance trilogy was much better. This just fell flat for me."
5,"Having previously owned a Kindle, I was not expecting that e-book readers had much improved over the last year. Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.  When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.  Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.  I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch."
5,I have 4 TV's all mounted on these.  They are easy to put up and attach to the TV.  They rotate and swing in every direction.  I recommend them all the time.
4,It has a ton of information great resource but a of lot of stuff to read through before you find what you are looking for.  Over all worth the money!
5,"This book is an exceptionally clear and informative *introduction* to all the major parts of the Mac OS.  Screen shots of every action are shown, and important parts of each window are clearly designated.  This book covers only the Mac OS itself, including topics such as various settings and preferences, attaching devices, networking, and backing up, and use of a few of the built-in programs (mail, contacts, address book, itunes, ichat, etc.)  It does not cover any of the well-known third-party applications such as Photoshop, MS Office, etc.  The information is crystal-clear, thanks to carefully done page layout, and there is lots of good explanation and guidance.  Occasional red-box warnings of important gotchas are not overused, thus effective.  The Mac system has become so elaborate and capable over the years so that I'm not on top of many parts of the system as I used to be.  Thus, for many aspects of the system, it was good to see this book's first steps for how to use a feature, or turn a capability on or off, that I haven't yet dealt with myself.  However, content does not go beyond the first steps, so an experienced Mac user may want a different, more thorough, Mac OS book.  This book is ideal for new-to-the-Mac users.  Two useful things:  First, purchase of the book also offers online access to it for 45 days.  Secondly, there are two tables of contents, one the brief overview of chapter heads, the next with the detailed list of topics.  The one problem I had with the book is that, despite the thoroughness of the index, some of the topics that PC migrants might look for are missing.  For example, the index has no entry for ""screen saver"" settings, which I guess are covered under ""sleep mode"" and energy saving settings.  Hardly a fatal flaw.  For its intended audience, this book is easily worth 5 stars.  But if you're not a Mac beginner, parts of the book would be useful to you, though you probably would prefer a more detailed advanced Mac OS book."
5,This is just a small little album but it is awesome. I love it. It looks like a camera lens. It looks old. It is easy to carry with you and holds just the right number of pictures to show off. I would get another one. I think it is perfect for photographer who likes to show off their pics.
5,for the price you just cant beat this item. I bought it for a house I was selling so I could hang some tv and it worked great. Good quality for the price.
5,"very secure, we did have to use concrete bolts thought since we were putting it on an outside wall made of lath and plaster with concrete brick on the outside.  One of the best features is there is one piece that attaches to the tv and another that attaches to the wall.  the piece on the tv actually hooks onto the piece on the wall.  I am really happy with this purchase."
5,"This is a must have for the nook.  You can project anything on your display to the tv such as netflix, applications such as games. No other tablet i know of does this at HD quality.  I use it like a DVR."
5,"Totally love this product!! I bought two - one for living room, one for bedroom.  I decided to try my hand in the bedroom first (in case I got frustrated and didn't finish the project). I've gotten items needing to be assembled before with all the hardware in one bag -- not so with this product!!  I'm impressed! Every nut, bolt, screw, washer, etc. is clearly packaged (individually by size and labeled!) The Arm also comes assembled -- which I disassembled for easier handling (the wall plate is attached to the Arm with two Carriage Bolts / easy to remove and makes holding in place while bolting to the wall a breeze).  Took me 1-1/2 hours from start (gathering my tools) to finish (hanging the TV)  Oh, and I'm a 56 yr old disabled female.  I do have a  lot of construction/tool knowledge however."
5,"Every few years I read a book that just grips me and this is my new ""book of the year.""  I laughed aloud, cried copious tears, and in-between could not put it down.  It is the story of two brothers, the older a self-centered bully, the younger a near perfect kid everyone loves.  The story alternates between the present day  (early seventies) and flashbacks to their childhood. While I agree with some reviewers that at times the flashbacks ramble a bit too much, and I did skim a few of them, on the whole they are very important for setting the personalities, characters, and relationship of the two brothers.  At times I was confused as to what was happening, but this is not uncommon in a mystery style book; in this case my confusion mirrored that of the main character because he, too, was having difficulty assimilating all the events.  I would have liked a little more wrap-up at the end, but in reality I think this is really because I had so much crawled into the characters' skins that I was reluctant to leave.  This book isn't perfect: it could use some tighter editing.  But the story is so captivating and original, the characters so alive, becoming part of my life, and still living within me almost three months later, that the rest become minor details.  I loved it."
5,"While I'm pretty sure I got the wrong item when I ordered this mount that supports larger TV / Monitors, the one I have supports larger than what I needed it for, so I'm not complaining. I have a somewhat heavy Hanspree 28"" TV / Monitor that works very well with the VideoSecu brand. I LOVE being able to swing and swivel it however I want. The only downside to these are that the tilt angle is not great, but with newer TVs, the viewing angles are much better than they were in 2008-2010, so it matters a little less. I mounted mine upside down because of the position over the window, and under a shelf with my routers and it works awesome. Very happy with this swivel style mount. Exactly what I wanted, even if I did get a wrong, smaller version."
5,"Jack Nightingale is a former British police negotiator who quits the force after a child he is trying to save jumps.  Cut to a few years into the future and Jack keeps hearing randomly: ""You're going to hell, Jack Nightingale""  Jack soon finds out that his parents are not who he thought they were.  His real father gives him a mansion out in the countryside.  There are noises in the house.  Things start to happen to people around Jack.  Jack is determined to find out who he is and what has been done to him.  Without giving more away, Jack's adventure to discover himself is both nerve wracking and compelling.  I've really got to say that I'm happy to have found Stephen Leather and this novel.  ""Nightfall"" is book one of three books around Jack Nightingale.  I was able to find the second book on the US Amazon site, ""Midnight"" but the last book, you'll have to wait for.  Jack is a fun character to read about as he discovers that demons to exist and that many things that he took for granted are not just so.  The book is well written and is definitely a page turner.  The creepy effect of reading about various characters randomly tell Jack that he's going to Hell, made this a creepy book to read at night.  I would definitely recommend this one and the book after.  Turns out that there are even more Stephen Leather books if you look him up too."
5,"The device itself is amazing...  -great TOUCHSCREEN interface -perfect reading screen -clean looking design, small because there is no keyboard to make it bigger and it's smaller than the original Nook -reads formats natively that the Kindle won't -read all the ebooks you want in B&N stores for free -library checkouts are easy -press and hold on a word to get its definition -highlight and take notes in a book easily  ...but when you ROOT the thing it gets even better!  -Install the Gmail app to get your mail -get the Opera browser (supports Flash!) -install the Kindle app and you can read Kindle ebooks too -Put it in host mode to attach an external keyboard -Make sure to get the Home Button Savior app so you can switch back and forth between the B&N reader and the rest of the device's functionality.  I used these instructions:  [Amazon removed my link.  Google ""Root Nook Touch Using TouchNooter & Install Go Launcher, NookColor Tools, Gmail, Market & YouTube"", it's the top link. ]  I will be buying LOTS of these as gifts, and I'm going to root them all!  This is a perfect device for hackers and regular ebook readers too!  What's a Kindle?  Never heard of it."
5,"I had to improvise by using more washers to mount my modern flat screen TV to it.  The screws are too long for my TV so I had to add a bunch (5 each for each of the four corners).  If not, you could screw into your picture area. Each TV will be different.  My guess is this was designed for an old model TV that was thicker than today's sets."
5,"worked perfectly to place a tv in the corner and have it angle out to the rest of the room.  good flexibility with tilting the arms, and very easy to install into one stud.  would recommend."
5,"This is a good item. Even though it's old, it's sticks to what an reader should be. It really is good for just reading books. It has great battery and the 3G works everywhere"
3,Since we still have original Nooks we thought we still had a need for these chargers.  We found Nook chargers to be very delicate and not long lasting but they did charge the Nook quickly.  Now we use a regular charger and just let the Nooks charge over-night when we want to use them.  Only three stars since I would buy another one depending on the need and for quick charging.  Minus two stars for being too delicate.
5,"This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.  Potential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.  The focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.  Sagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.   It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.  For me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family."
5,Bought this unit a few years ago and now it looks radically different. It has kept my TV up on the wall very sell and has survived 3 soon to be 4 moves. If I had a need for another mount I would buy again from this company without a question.
5,"I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes:  I used to have a Kindle 3. It was great. It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change. I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.  When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like. Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased. I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself. You can find that just about anywhere. What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier. I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.  Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it??  With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty). Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen. Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app. I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch. The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway. Yes it has a web browser, email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device. That isn't why I did this. I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.  I now have the best of both worlds."
5,Awesome story and superbly written. It was hard to put the book down. The story moved fast and the characters were very well developed. Ava Miles is an excellent author and to that end I've purchased the next book in the series and I will likely start purchasing the rest.
5,"The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.  You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.  The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.  Summary: While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.  You can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook, iPhone, a PC and a Mac."
5,"High Points: -Easy to read screen -Touchscreen responsive -Love the physical page turning keys on either side (wish the NookColor had this feature) -Size (can hold it easily in one hand) -Lots of Free Classic Books and Classic Books available for 99 cents -Easily transfer books from your library from device to device (any Nook device or device with a Nook App) -Very organized library (and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the Nook has been turned off) -Beautiful design & feels very sturdy and well made -Great accessories -Battery Life (charge lasts about 10 days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours everyday-MUCH better than the NookColor which gets about 3 days with comparable usage) -eLend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature (which is the only reason I chose this over the Kindle) -Free Updates (as the software improves, you won't have to buy a new device to get the upgrades, like faster page turning, better internet experience, etc) -Free eBook Fridays via the Barnes & Noble store  Lower Points: -Delay between turning the page (not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page, which I personally don't like) -Weight (you get used to it, but it could be lighter) -Browsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome. Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in eink  Conclusion: If you don't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader, I think this is a great choice. I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor. I definitely read a lot more books now and it's easy to take with me everywhere I go."
5,"the reason ill take a eInk reader over a kindle eInk reader,  is because the nook has expandable memory (up to 32GB). when you get to the fire and nook color/tab its a different story. the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing. if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect. feels great in the hand, the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy. although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.  the only thing you have to get use to is the screen being a little jumpy when you switch from one thing to another. i believe its because of the eInk style."
5,"Once I started this book, I couldn't quit. I was sure that Jack would find a way out of his predicament and I had to find out how he managed it. I loved every single page. Although the emphasis of the book description is on the supernatural elements of the book, Nightfall does not really fall neatly into a single genre. Yes, the supernatural figures prominently, but the book is, at heart, a mystery, with Jack, in true private investigator fashion, doggedly following one lead to another to another in his efforts to unravel the puzzle dropped in his lap by a man who claimed to be his father. Add in a few discussions of philosophy and religion (What happens after you die? What is the meaning of life?) and more humor than I expected and you get a pleasing, well rounded story.  Jack Nightingale is an appealing character -  likable, funny, smart, and yet in many ways very ordinary. The other characters in the book ranged from bizarre to ordinary, but all were entirely believable and felt very real.  I highly recommend this book to almost anyone. If the book sounds interesting to you, go ahead and pick up a copy because you are likely to enjoy it. I can't wait to start the second book in this series."
5,"Used to mount a 47"" LG LCD.  I keep this thing extended fully from the wall almost all of the time with the tv at a perpendicular angle to the wall.  I was skeptical any stand would hold up for this kind of use long term.  Its pretty easy to install even if there weren't instructions (2 bolts).  It's held up perfectly so far, no wobble or anything.  Feels sturdy like it will last forever.  Good buy."
3,"It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat, compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesn't run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hub  It does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging. I guess it's better to have it at the plug."
5,"For the price it can't be beat.  The mount is strong and sturdy.  Two sets of hands are mandatory for mounting, three would be ideal.  Once up though, it's better than most of our friends mounts.  It has full articulation, and I can swing the arm out and angle it towards my kitchen.  This is highly important while cooking buffalo wings and trying to keep tabs on football games."
5,"Fantastic device!  Easy to use, simple to carry.  Does exactly what it says on the box.  Mounts w/o any strangeness right on the desktop so you can move epub files on and off it as you wish, with no additional software.  Love it."
5,"I love everything about this mount. It's versatile, holds our 30"" LCD TV no problem and is discreet. My only complaint at all is that the instructions for mounting lacked a little detail but we looked up some videos and everything was fine. Most of the other mounts I found were twice the price so this is certainly a good deal!"
1,"I used the card only a few times and this last time it failed and would not reformat, be recognized, etc.  I lost a once in a lifetime ski videos."
5,"Great e-reader! The user interface is great, atractive, smooth and clean!  There were only 2 minnor issues:  1. The built-in Wi-Fi couldn't connect to my home network, but a simple software update from the B&N support page fixed that.  2. The description says that the device has a 2GB internal memory, the one I got doesn't have that amount of memory.  Probably someone forgot to insert the 2GB SD Card in the device, but that's not a big deal!  Overrall, great device!!!"
5,"Many ""mysteries"" follow a formula, and you can start to predict where they're going l-o-n-g before the curtain falls. Here's the opposite--a book that keeps you guessing from beginning to end. At first, it's a memoir of life in a raucous Irish Catholic family (fascinating to a girl who grew up in a Methodist household with one sister). Then tragedy strikes, and nothing is as it seems to be. I can't say much more without risk of spoilage, aside from the fact that I read the whole book in one sitting. Hats off to Mr. Enright for weaving such an intricate and intriguing tale."
5,"VERY HAPPY, it looks great, I'm so happy we got it. Holds good, it is a lil hard to get it to the wall. Other then that its fine I love how we have more room in our room. My husband is so happy I ordered this, it only cost us $28 free shipping and FAST(: VERY THANKFUL TO THE SELLER."
5,"What can I say except wow - this book was really good! This is the first time I have checked out anything by S. Leather before but I will say that this makes me want to check out a Book Two.  Jack Nightingale, former cop turned private investigator, finds out from his shogun-eating bio-dad that he was not only adopted but that the there was little issue with his soul. In his birthday he is told that it has kind of been sold to the devil. This leads to Jack try to overcome the pact and into some really interesting story features. Makes you kind of wonder if he'll just skip the next few birthdays, too.  I don't want to short the story with the breakdown that gives away anything major but I also do not want this to sound too basic so I want to note that leaving the synopsis at that because of spoilers, noting that if the description sounds good, read it. It  takes a lot more turns and is very effective in not only in making me want to continue reading but also in fleshing out the characters and making them interesting. That's a feat a lot of tales fall short attempting but that this does well. 5/5 - well recommended"
5,"This micro SD card works great. I bought this card for my champagne 64GB Asus Prime. But I still didn't have it on hands so I used it on My MetroPCS Lg Esteem android phone and it worked. 3 day ago I received my Asus prime. Inserted the card in and boommmm, now I have close to 120 GB on my tablet. Load card with MKV movies and music. Movies play directly from the micro card. Good quality card. Movies are perfect on the tablet."
5,"There is so much I want to tell you all, I want to talk about the amazing ride that this book was.  So much excitement, sadness, fear, happiness...a real roller coaster!  Honestly I have to bite my tongue, I don't want to give anything away.  As you read, the survivors are locked in a research center, and have been for 3 years.  2 men, considered the leaders are the only 2 to leave now because of the very real danger of the ""shifters.""  These creations are so very hard to kill, they heal so fast that the only way to kill them to slice them fully in half.  Oh my stars, I want to go on but I can't.  The characters are so realistic, the plot is heavy - but in a good way.  The pacing is amazing.  It's 233 pages long and I don't think it ever slowed down.  Even the sexy scenes were intense!  The cover is spooky - I'm not sure about the spider web unless it's meant to signify the abandoned city of Pittsburgh.  The red cats eyes...well you'll read about him in the book.  This would make a kick-ass movie!  The e-book is only $2.99 - take a chance.  :)"
3,"This book is specific to Snow Leopard, which means it's obsolete for anyone currently buying a new Mac.  But if you're buying one used (or an archaeologist reading this millions of years in the future) you might find it useful.  Apple has a reputation for design and ease of use, but the nuts and bolts of a Mac are harder to grasp or learn about.  Since Macs don't come with an instruction manual (just a shiny little book that says ""hello"" on the cover) it's useful to have something like this around.  It's beautifully illustrated with screen captures, but strangely organized - things will appear in the sidebar that aren't explained until much later. It can be difficult to use as a quick reference, which, in my opinion, is really what an everyday user needs; this is meant to be read cover to cover, and by that point, you're a Mac genius."
5,"This is the first novel I've read by this author.  It has captivated me as it moves right along gripping my mind and heart.  People may appear to be different from many of us, but once one takes the time to learn about others ... well, they may very well become soul mates.  Such as Rock Star Rye Crenshaw and Tory Simmons surprise themselves.  This is a compelling, sometimes disturbing story, but it remains very hopeful as the pages turn very quickly.  Highly recommend this well written novel of love."
5,"I put this on my outdoor deck using a 32' Vizio LCD. It is strong and tilts in all directions so it is easy to turn to the right angle that you need to view it, left to right and up and down. Highly recommend."
5,Well constructed wall mount for TV sets up to 37 inches. The mounting  plate has numerous holes for varius sets. Plenty of extra hardware provided. Price was about 1/8th of what it would cost on the open market. I recommend it highly.
5,"Needed the extra memory for my new Galaxy tablet 10.1.  Local costs were high and this was more reasonable and in stock.  On arrival, plugged it in and have not had an issue since."
5,"As much as I hate classes that require the i>clicker, it works fine, has a long range, and is well designed. Only problem I have is with the expense, but there aren't any cheaper alternatives so it's fine."
5,"Oh what a story. I was hooked from the beginning. This story had be tearing up, laughing and in shock. I loved it. The characters are full of that pull you in and  love them. Great work!"
5,"SanDisk brands are my favorite, never had any problems. They're guanteed. I am a power user, in photography, on my cellphone and to me ""external storage"" is important. I need a product that will not fail on me. The SanDisk Ultra lets you transfer large files at great speed. It does make a big difference, and to top it all, the price is phenomenally great. 5 stars in my book. Thank you."
5,"I now have TWO of these fantastic Articulating Arms. One for my computer monitor(24"") and one for a monitor I use as bot a TV and spare monitor(21"") for my laptop.  This is a stable, solid, very well constructed device. Highly adaptible to the many VESA as well as some non-standard mounting holes out there. I was worried that since I was using the VESA 100 holes the mounting plate might stick out to far, but even on the 21"" it doesnt stick out at all.  The instructions are very well written and provide good graphical representations. The arm is easy to mount to the wall, and to the monitor/T.V.. Compacts well to the wall when pushed all the way in, and extends easily when I want to move the Monitor out and around.  Very stable, no vibrations, appears very solid, you won't be worried your monitor is going to fall off.  The only piece missing is the ability to adjust it up and down. You can adjust the Arm left, right, in and out, and so on, you can even adjust the tilt of the monitor, but if you need to be able to move the monitor up and down, this is not the arm for you.  For the money, you cannot beat the quality or functionality of this Articulating Arm."
5,"Irrefutable kept me reading all the way. Dale Roberts knows how to tell a story and he makes it hard to put down. I liked the characters and the twists and turns along the way. Good job, I hope we see more from this author."
5,"I now have tons of room for music, videos and photos. The SD card formats to about 59 GB, which is normal for a SIII - The phone's operating system uses up several gigs of any SD chip.  It came pre-formatted (I think) but I went ahead and re-formatted it just to be safe.  Formatting only takes a few seconds.  There are numerous Youtube videos on how to install/format an SD chip for this phone - take a look if you are a newbie."
2,"The mount plate and the extender arms need to be screwed together and there are two holes for each arm to attach to the corner of the plate. The holes don't align so I couldn't put two screws in. I just used one screw which is not the most secure attachment. Then I used zip ties to secure the arm better. I did this because I had to install the tv ASAP and could not wait for a replacement. Also, the mounting bracket that attaches to the wall has a larger screw hole on the bottom. This means that the bottom can wiggle and the bracket will be misaligned. Again, I did a quick fix. I gave this 2 stars and not 1 because it actually stayed up on the wall and is now holding my tv, albeit due to my own ingenuity and not the quality of the mount. I should not have to do quick fixes on a product like this."
3,"The product works but the connector just barely makes contact,  if you move the device at all it breaks the connection.  If you have your Nook in a case it won't work at all. The only reason I gave it three stars was I was able to solve the problem by trimming the plastic edge down  with a razor blade,  this allowed the plug to engage more securely.  Perhaps I got a bad unit since others don't seem to have this problem. Also,  you have to have it plugged into a power supply to work which was unable expected."
5,"I really like the action on this mount.  I purchased a 27"" monitor for my wife and this mount really frees up the desktop real estate.  I would purchase again."
5,Excellent mount with tons of different mounting options.  I used this to mount a fairly old (13 years) LCD TV in our home gym and was very concerned that the mounting brackets would not match up...I was wrong.  Because of the included extra parts and various configurations I was able to seamlessly wall mount our TV and position it perfectly in our gym.  GREAT product with simple straight forward instructions.
5,"I have purchased and used two with the Hero Black 4 and so far they have worked fine. The video quality seemed to transfer nicely and the transfer speed seems quick enough. Their build is about average for an SD card as far as I can tell. I wouldn't recommend playing finger football with them but to each his own.  Unfortunately, the camera itself is a bit shaky when I record, but I highly doubt that has anything to do with the memory card. Regardless, figured it might be useful information to someone."
5,"I have three of these mounts on one wall with 32"" tvs on them.  Very easy to install. Prevented thieves from taking my tvs when they broke in last year."
5,"I mounted my 42"" Sony that weighs in around 35 pounds to this and it worked perfectly.  I had to tighten the bolts that swivel the tv up and down as it kept ""slipping"" downward on me - but no big deal: I didn't need it to swivel like that anyhow.  Very well built and secure - I trust my daughter standing under it if I had to."
5,"Good wall mount. Sturdy and does what it is supposed to do. In fact, it even held a larger TV than what it was listed as capable of holding. I believe I mounted a 42"" television with this one. Not a flat-flat one either. I mounted an older heavy thick one."
5,"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth. It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages. Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.  At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father, I found this book particularly captivating. My father talked about the elephants, the native Kachin, Chindit, Naga, and Burmese peoples, the Imperial Forces, native built bashas, and the jungle and its wildlife. At 90, Dad also found the book quite riveting.  This account has outstanding character development, scene description, and intrigue. Highly recommended for all ages, 10-90! Elephant Run"
5,"This is the most useful book on Lion I have found after 7 months on a new macbook pro. I have read many of the other intermediate level lion books and found them wanting. Ray's Lion covers the useful stuff without losing you in detail, humorous side journeys, rush-to-press errors, or leaving out essentials. If I upgrade to Mountain Lion in 6 months, I will buy Ray's book on that.

4,"Took a bit of work, but used this to fit an older vizio 32"" monitor to the wall to use as a compute monitor. Stable and like the ability to move the tv to different angles. The vizio was older and did not have the standard holes, this product fit and holds the tv very stable."
5,Not really much to say about a products that does what it is expected to.  It's worth the investment for any smart phone owner who's phone supports 64gb additional memory.
5,"If you are looking into purchasing a Chromebook you will find it worth your while to read this ($15) book first. It is a well balanced review of the Chromebook's strengths and weaknesses and will either save you a few hundred dollars or convince you of the wisdom of the purchase. There is also a GREAT review under the ""Samsung Chromebook"" product by Lance Haun that will help you (as it has over 2,000 other folks). Good reading and NOT too technical."
5,"This thing has been through so much. Closed in doors, thrown across the room, been the object of desire in a toddler tug of war and it still keep working. It i just fantastic! To any one complaining that he app store for barns and noble is too small I say just sideload google play with the root kit. It is easy and doecker skills to do."
5,"We've been using this for about six months now without any problems. It's REALLY handy for when your vacation plans get a last-minute change due to weather! Just connect an HDMI cable to the hotel's TV, fire up your Netflix / Prime Video app, and away you go!"
5,"I've been using this for over 6 months now, without a single issue to report.  SanDisk is one of the staple brands that offers these memory cards, and has for many years, because although they might not offer the top 1% in quality, they offer more per dollar spent on their products than the products that might outperform them.  These are simply a good staple for memory cards, with a long average product lifespan."
1,"Used in a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 since May 2014. Card went into a ""read-only"" state with no way to reverse sometime in August 2015; noticed issues after photos started getting erratically corrupted and would seemingly disappear after several days (power cycle).  Phone wouldn't write to card, computer wasn't able to format, and no device other than the phone was able to read the filesystem. This is apparently a common problem with SanDisk's earlier batches of this card, but this is the third SanDisk storage solution I've had fail on me in the past two years and I won't be coming back."
5,"Installed easily, has a nice long reach.  Attached a 32"" TV for the grandkids and it works out great. accomodates many different size TV's and was a very good price."
4,"For the price, this wall mount is great.  Not too hard to install.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is wire management.  I could not get the little loop to work.  Not a big deal at all however.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.  Well worth the money."
4,"Although the plot was predictable from early on, this was an inspiring book.  The reminders of God's amazing Grace, as well as his protection and guidance were so good to read. It was an emotional read, as we get to know all of the characters, with a tense denouement and a peaceful resolution."
5,"This story's characters are true to life and so feisty! You will love the developing story line as the characters wind their way to friendship, and then to true love between 2 very different people. The humor is extremely well done and the storyline very well written. Dare River tales are as entertaining as the Dare Valley series, and some of the folks even crossover between the 2."
5,"Perfect... This works great.  I went to Costco to see how much the wall mounts were there, I found it for around $180. I figured why not check on amazon, I found it there for $25.  It came on time, Exactly what I ordered it is not plastic its metal strong. Even though I only put a 24 inch TV on it I would be perfectly confident putting any size TV on it. I love it!!!  Pro's Well Made Metal Strong Easy Set Up Several Mounting Figuration  Con's None"
5,"I have to say I could not get in to this book at the beginning.  It took until she started taking care of the children for me to really start enjoying the book and being unable to put it down until my eyes were drooping and I had too.  I loved the way she cared for A_______ when he was ill.  I loved her connection with the children and how she influenced and helped them, loving them and caring for their needs and more.  I loved the story being strong with God's redemptive power and the acceptance of His grace in their lives.  And I love good endings.  Loved this book once it started flowing for me!"
5,"Installed easy and in no time at all (finding the stud was the hardest part for me).  Articulates well with the 40"" TV on it. I would not hesitate to look for this brand when it is time for the next TV mount."
5,"I purchased the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and the original Nook (the B&W one) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!  Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.  In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N's website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.  Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.  The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.  One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the ""Shop"" tab to access B&Ns website.  Every Friday B&N offers a free book for download, and has discounts on other days of the week."
5,"JUST IN STALL ANOTHER SAMSUNG 55"" LED FLAT SCREEN. OUTSIDE A  PATIO DECK AREA WHAT A DIFFERENCE THIS UNIT MADE.THE MOUNTING KIT WAS VERY EASY TO USE. AGAIN I DID UPGRADED TO  USING LONGER HEAVIER MOUNTING BOLTS. THAT WAS ONLY $1.00 MORE BUT IT'S WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN. HERE IN EARTHQUAKE COUNTRY YOU NEES THAT SUPPORT. YOUR FLATSCREEN TV RETRACTS A FEW INCHES OFF THE WALL PLUS IT WILL LOOK SWEET FROM 2"" TO 24"" FROM WALL AREA"
5,"This is the most fantastic device imaginable. It has traveled to England, Scotland, Turkey, Egypt and Qatar and has even taken a cruise! It has traveled around in a purse, a briefcase and a carryon. It has downloaded books in PDF as well as the e-pub format, from Barnes & Noble as well as other suppliers. It has borrowed and loaned books. It also gets automatic software updates and even accesses the web to check e-mail or the latest news. This is one device that will never disappoint.  So easy to read. A big plus is that when you search for a subject on B&N, once it has exhausted the B&N offerings (some free!), it goes on to list all the Google Books in the same category. If you make selections of Google books those are downloaded exactly the same as paid selections. I love the way this all happens automatically. You don't have to do anything at all. You can also add audio books, other audio files. The approximately 1,500 book capacity plus the capability of adding more storage is another real plus."
5,"I did a lot of research on the different ebook Readers before purchasing my NOOK.  I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.  The Kindle does not offer that kind of service.  All in all I am very happy with my NOOK and would recommend one to anyone looking for an ebook Reader."
5,"I have always been a fairly skeptical critic of e-readers.  When I first heard of the Kindle, I thought the idea was pretty absurd, to need an electronic device that mimics something as universally understood as a book.  However, as I grew older and grew more cynical that I will probably never get my 10+ books I've lent out over the years back, the idea of an e-reader started to sound more desirable.  Enter the Nook.  I've read a lot of bad press on this little guy.  Most of the bad press seemed to stem from consumer reviews, which I honestly take to heart more-so than professional critics.  Here is a list of things I've noticed people don't seem entirely too fond of regarding the Nook, and my experience with these 'negative' aspects.  - Battery Life.  Although shorter than some e-readers (but not at ALL as short as the Nook color or any tablets you may purchase/already have) I haven't yet felt constricted or nervous that my battery will deplete midway through a book.  I would think that considering the era we're in of constantly recharging our phones (I have to recharge my Droid Incredible nearly every 8 hours after moderate usage) we would be a little more forgiving if the Nook only lasts a mere week.  I don't mind recharging it once/twice a week while I sleep... I don't think anyone should to be honest, but that's just me.  - LCD touch screen. This is one of those gripes I find somewhat warranted.  This is definitely the reason for the shorter battery life (set it to sleep after 10 or 30 seconds, and brightness to about 15%) but my biggest gripe is that it can be unresponsive at times.  I never once, however, found the navigation to be clunky or as unresponsive as some people claim... but I think these gripes found in earlier reviews has been remedied through a major update to the Nook firmware.  Yay!  I found the navigation to be highly intuitive and the built in dictionary highly helpful.  I love this thing.  I love being able to read Barnes & Noble classics for free, checking e-books out from the library, and the prospect of sharing books with others who own a Nook.  This is an excellent piece of technology, and for the price it's going for right now... a HUGE steal.  Get one if you're on the fence, you won't regret it."
5,"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth. It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages. Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.  At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father, I found this book particularly captivating. My father talked about the elephants, the native Kachin, Chindit, Naga, and Burmese peoples, the Imperial Forces, native built bashas, and the jungle and its wildlife. At 90, Dad also found the book quite riveting.  This account has outstanding character development, scene description, and intrigue. Highly recommended for all ages, 10-90! Elephant Run"
5,"Bought this for my son and surprised him with some of his favorite pictures from his senior year in high school. He loved that it had a classic, sleek cover!"
5,"I spent a couple of months comparing the Nook and the Kindle. They are both great at what they were made for. My friend bought a Nook and after I looked at it, my decision was made. I bought one that afternoon. I've enjoyed it since then. I'm a voracious reader and have filled the Nook with over 30 books in about 6 weeks. There has only been one problem downloading one book. And, after speaking with one of their wonderful customer service agents for 5 minutes, the problem was solved. If you like to just read books on an e-ink screen, this e-reader is for you."
4,"As good as the reviews say it is and as easy to mount.  I was able to do it alone by mounting the X frame to the TV after removing it by separating the long center bolt between the dual and single extension arms.  Just be aware, replacing that bolt is MUCH easier with a second person but everything else is a breeze.  Oh and all the extras screws for swapping out different sets is a plus.  I mounted a 32"" ultra thin (15 lbs) Samsung LED."
5,"It works. It's interesting, I got one assembled in Mexico and it recently started to not work without a hard push on the buttons.  This one, identical in every way, is assembled in Korea. Seems to be better made.  Go figure.  But, it works,,,, I am happy"
5,"I will continue to update this review as I discover new features of the Nook, so stay tuned folks!  ***************************************************************************** Updated 02/08/2010 *****************************************************************************  I've been using my Nook with the newest update (v 1.2) for a few days now.  This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!  The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!  Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.  All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.  ***************************************************************************** Updated 01/31/2010 *****************************************************************************  This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's ""wade in the weeds"" and look at some of the features in detail:  LCD Touchscreen  So far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.  The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.  Wi-fi  The built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.  Memory Expansion  The Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.  Appearance  This is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking ""not too bad"" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.  Book formats and availability  This is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.  eInk display  It seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.  Replacable battery  This is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.  Battery life  A lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.  Ease of use  The Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.  Summary  There are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.  ******************************* Update *******************************  So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N network and connected without me even having to tell it to!  As it turns out there is exclusive content at each B&N store, at this particular one there were multiple books that could be downloaded for FREE!!!  So, seeing one that piqued my interest I naturally downloaded it.  Wow, super fast and convenient, and FREE!"
5,"I have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it.  My mom owns a Kindle, one sister a Nook Color, another sister a 1st Edition Nook...so I've seen my fair share of e-readers.  I did the research before I bought.  I actually bought my dad a Kindle 3G for Father's Day.  But the light weight of the Nook Touch was great for me.  I have problems with my hands and their abilities, so after a full day of commuting, typing, and writing, they've reached their peak.  It was the right choice for me."
5,"I got this for my Amaze 4G and it works just fine. Has been for over a month now. The phone had to format the card first, of course, and I wound up with 59.x gigs of usable space. Thank you SanDisk. I have more storage on my phone now than I know what to do with."
4,"As you might expect from the title (and the cover) this is a lighter collection...the tie that binds the three novellas together is a vampire named Angelina.  She meddles (in a good way) in the romantic lives of two other couples--the stories that make up the first two stories.  The first one is the lightest, the second one gets a little more serious as it involves the involuntary changing of a man with a terminal illness.  The third story is one for Angelina herself, and it is the most serious (in an obvious ""It's a Wonderful Life"" sort of way).  The background for the stories is that it is a given that vampires have been accepted as real, and overall are integrating into society.  There is very little blood lust/blood sucking going on (well, yes, from those Icky Criminals in the third story, but overall it's all very sanitary).  The author did a great job of setting the background in an unobtrusive way, and then just giving us the stories.  If the author was so inclined, she could easily expand into full length novels where we could learn the hows and whys of the world, but really she does a great job giving us just enough that she can stick to the shorter tales, and the shorter tales feel complete.  And naughty.  Did I mention naughty?  These are a little naughty.  Great little set of stories if these are what you are in the mood for.  Recommended!  JTG"
1,"Seller replaced the first one which the connection would cut out periodically, the replacement they sent is also not working, the sound and picture cuts out every couple of minutes, this happens with most slimport adapters I've used for my LG g3. If you need to transmit picture from phone to tv and your phone has slimport, try looking into streaming like dlna or Google chromecast etc."
5,"Loved mine so much, bought one for my friend.....now, we trade (or borrow) books from each other 2000 miles away from each other.  She had stopped reading regular books because the print was too small (phenominom that happens as you get older (lol) I told her she could make the fonts larger than life with the Nook.... The very first book she read was one that she borrowed from me.  When I talked to her the day after she got her Nook, she told me she had already read half of the book......Thanks to Nook, we are all reading more."
5,My old Time Warner remote was causing me to pull my hair out. Bought this and has worked like a charm. All along I thought my TWC box was to blame and all I had was a defective remote. Should TWC have provided me a replacement? Yes. But this was much faster and works great.
5,"WWorks great, and with 64GB of space available, who could complain.  I use it in my DSLR with an adaptor, but the option to offload my photos to my Droid phone is great, since it is a Micro Card."
5,"Mounted 42"" Samsung LED in home office with this mount.  The arm that leaves the wall is longer than the others I've used and pivots in the middle, so it's easy to get the TV in whatever position you want it.  I was concerned it may not be as stable when it is fully extended, but that wasn't the case.  Very stable when fully extended."
5,"I initially chose this book because it was free.  I am glad I selected it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This one was hard to put down, I liked the plot and the characters.  It was interesting from the beginning.  I really like reading Detective Mysteries, and I will look for more from this author."
5,"I have had this a few days and I love it! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus! I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press. Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!"
5,"**UPDATE: Had this over 5 years. No problems!  Great wall mount at a great price.  Already fully assembled out of the box and seems built to last.  I really like the swivel and tilt as we need it when laying down in the bedroom.  Easy instructions (I'm not a carpenter).  I used this on a 32"" Samsung LED TV."
5,"This is exactly what I needed.  It was easy to mount and supports my 40 inch TV (26 lbs) without any issue.  I haven't tested the extension brackets, but the rest of the device is very solid.  I will say that the hinges can be a bit tight, and it's not designed to be easily adjustable on the fly (you'll need a few tools).  If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.  Speaking of which, I've mounted two TVs on this, and the box included screws which fit both (in addition to many more).  However, you may need a few more washers."
5,"I am so pleased with my new Nook Touch. I have already purchased 4 books and am reading them all. The best part is that there are so many good books that are free ( even one OT/NT free Bible)and most others are under $10. There is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the Nook has Wi-Fi. I really like everything about it, especially the fact that there is a battery that can be changed by B&N or by me after the warranty is out and the ability to visit B&N store for help. I would highly recommend."
4,It attached to our tv without the extention arms.  It only took minutes to install. The hinges are really stiff so we will move the tv while holding the wall mount not the tv. We worry it will pull to much on the TV and possibly crack it.  Hopefully with use it will move easier.  It is very easy to attach to the TV and the wall.
5,"In ""Bad Traffic,"" Simon Lewis tells a tale from an unfamiliar perspective (for most of us, anyway) - Inspector Jian is heading to England to save his girl, only he knows nothing about the culture, cannot speak the language, and is totally out of his element.  Throughout the novel, Jian must improvise.  His tale intertwines with that of Ding Ming, an ""indentured servant"" of sorts.  Ding Ming has been smuggled into England with his wife, hoping to make a better life but finding it torn to shreds.  Simon Lewis knows his stuff and does an excellent job in describing the difficulty Jian faces in England."
4,"These two books have two very well told stories without killing you with useless details or scenes that don't really contribute.  Both books were fun to read although I enjoyed Dark Horse the most.  The author has a knack for the ""one line zingers"" in each story and the charachters have cockiness about them that is almost comical, but at the same time, that adds to the fun of reading the stories.  Well Done!!"
5,"SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6: It comes with exFat format (59GB useable) that is compatible with internal sd card readers in laptops. I'm not sure about additional software/hardware to make it compatible with the external sd-card reader adapters. This limitation does not apply to NTFS format. It was automatically recognized by my table Toshiba Transformer with ICS. On my Samsung Galaxy Note with Gingerbread I had to reformat it with the exFat format. I believe Gingerbread is not compatible with NTFS format, so I have to keep it with the exFat format to have compatibility between my phone, my table and my laptop. This card also support NTFS format that is like 5% faster writing and almost the same speed reading compare with the exFat. The speed is like a Micro SD 32 class 10. I copied 37GB (music/videos/data)so far to this card without any issues. All my new cards must be 64GB now."
5,"Lots of storage space. A lot of high capacity micro SD cards do not come near their listed storage capacity. I get about 60/64 GB available here, which is great."
5,"Great for novels, not so great for non-fiction with photos and charts.  Does almost everything well. Compact, keeps a charge for 30 days or so.  The feel of it, the look of it.  It is special."
5,"I think we read this with our son in 3rd grade and again in 5th.  For a boy it is wonderful, with WWII history, an exotic locale, adventure, danger, rampaging elephants and more.  A wonderful and very accessible coming of age story.  We've read 3 or 4 of Smiths books -- a great ""go to"" author for kids in the upper elementary age group."
1,Very poor quality.  Cable loose at connection point.  Shipped from Hong Kong and took 3 weeks to arrive.  Pay the difference and get a good one to avoid the disappointment.
5,"Great addition to our new Galaxy S9's which, by the way, do not come with any SD media.  Was able to transfer data from my old phone's SD card quickly and easily."
4,"This mount is sturdy (I have a 32 inch LCD TV, it only weighs 11 lbs, but I'm pretty sure the mount weighs more...).  Installation was easy, all the parts and hardware that we needed (and didn't need!) were in the box.  We had it up in very little time.  It's great.  One person could hang it alone, but two makes it much easier.  It has multiple points that you can level the television, so it doesn't necessarily need to be perfectly level (the installation person for me got it right).  There is no list, and it holds position really well."
5,"Now, I love the NOOK. After I changed it to an Android System. Bought ""AndroidForNook 32GB Jelly Bean Dual-Boot"". Tons of free Apps now! You can buy 8 ~ 16 ~ 32 GB cards for the change. And, you download ""Nook for Android"" (through Google Play) then you have all the books, etc... that you purchased on NOOK!!  It's the best of both worlds, then. Just do it - It's so much better!!"
5,"This is a great product, well-designed, easy to mount, easy to adjust. I bought this to put a new Samsung 28 flatscreen in my wife's office. With her help, we got everything done in about a half hour or so. The mount is excellent. It adjusts in every way, adjustments are easy to make and everything stays in place once adjusted. The great thing about this unit is that everything is included in the box--screws for the back of the TV, lag bolts to screw into a stud wall, even a small wrench to make the tilt and leveling adjustments. Very high quality product. Buyers should note that an electric drill, drill bit, Phillips screwdriver, and ideally a 1/2 inch rachet socket (a 1/2 inch box-end or open-end wrench would do) are needed, things that some households might not have in their toolbox. I recommend the product...but one must have the appropriate tools."
4,An enjoyable read.  Clean type with good and easy to follow instuctions.  Written on high quality paper.  Only critcism is that some of the reference pictures are so small that you can not read them.  Isn't that what this instructual book is all about?
5,"Had this for sevral months now and I love it. I love the touch screen which lets me see the covers of books in COLOR! VERY easy to set up account with B&N using my nook. It serches for wi-fi and is very easy. Anytime I have had any problem, a simple re-boot fixes it. I love the ""free Friday"" that is offered. I have read SOOO many books since I bought it. I also think I would like the ""Lend Me"" option if any of my friends HAD a nook."
4,I purchased this product not to use in commerical trucking but rather to use when I am traveling with my 5th wheel RV.  So far this product as been very good.  Rand McNally folks seem to be working to continue to improve the software along with prompt updates.  Although designed for the trucking industry it works great for us RV folks as well.  I found for a 2500 HD pickup the unit is a little large for the windshield.  I use the unit with a mount that fits in my cup holder and that has worked out great.  I would recommend this product.
5,"This is the second VideoSecu product I have ordered. They are rock-solid, and with the range of fasteners and extra hardware they include in the package, it's hard to imagine any speaker or TV that these systems won't fit."
5,Works great! I was working with a 32'' TV that I wanted to mount above my fridge. It moves around perfect and lets me do exactly what I wanted. It was hard finding a mount that would let me work in the small area. The arm has a great range of movement allowing me to get the perfect angle and distance for a good kitchen TV.
5,"Excellent tablet for a Android device. The HD graphics are much better than any iPad for a fraction of the cost. It allows multiple logins so that you can have a separate profile for your kids that is locked down on the apps you want them to run, unlike an iPad. The display and memory options are fantastic I would buy another!"
4,"For the money you can't go wrong. Yes, it has a litlle play in the mechanism but, you can adjust your mounting to accomodate that. It works great and frees up counter space. I would do it all again. Why spend 3 times more."
5,"This was needed to mount a 32"" LCD that weighs 27 lbs in my bedroom. I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.  1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?  2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.  3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)  4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.  5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32"" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already."
1,"This will not work reliably in an S4.  After installing and formatting it worked ok for 2 days.  Then it began unmounting itself anytime it was read or written to, resulting in a card that doesn't work anymore.  Searching various Samsun and SanDisk boards shows neither company will fess-up to a problem.  Cannot say how good this is in anything else.  I may wind up returning this to Amazon if I cannot find any other thing it will work in... e.g. BD disk player or camera."
3,This book has an engaging storyline and a few really well built characters but it also has about a million sub characters. They muddle the story and make it confusing. Sometimes it felt like no one had edited this book because there were so many nonessential characters. The authors added a ton of detail to every mini character which just watered down the entire story. It was hard to tell which characters we important and which were just side liners.
3,"Pages and pages of introspection, in the style of writers like Henry James.  I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and ""truths"" within the story.  It's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read."
5,"I bought this because my older nook battery is slowing down, and I love the nook.  You cannot easily buy a new battery, but I could still buy one of the original nooks.  No-brainer."
5,I read a lot and the glowlight turns on after just holding the Nook button down for 2 seconds. So this is very easy to turn on in the dark. I chose this over Kindle due to being able to use epub's and pdf's. I like the new Kindle e-ink better but I must have epub. Nook is an excellent compromise and you have the added benefit of rooting it and installing the Kindle android app to read any kindle purchases anyway.
5,"Geeze, how much smaller are they going to get with these. This is crazy. Bought for my GoPro and works great. Now I have to be disciplined in not loosing it!"
4,I liked it for the week we had it lol. Husband didn't tell me he was buying a 55 inch a week after we got this installed! Worked well and great price!
5,not just a how to book but more about: 1. where Google Chromebook fits into the computing universe and 2. strategies for using it productively.  author is very knowledgeable and writes clearly and well. Wish he was my tutor.
1,"I've had the card for a couple months it formatted in my tablet and I could write to it but it screwed up the sleep button, every time the screen went black the tablet turned off, when i replaced it with a 32gb card everything went back to working fine. Tried putting the 64 gb card in my Galaxy SIII, it formats and the phone recognizes the memory but I can write anything to it, it starts but then slows down and stops before it finishes. I can't format the card with windows 7 at all. The card is useless, i'm contacting SanDisk now to see if it's a problem with the batch but I'm probably just screwed."
5,I bought this for my spouse.  It is everything we could ask for.  I have a Kindle Fire HD and love it.  But this was 32 gb and does everything my Kindle does except it cost 200.00 less.  I recommend it very much!
5,Sturdy and light holder.  Amazingly flexible.  Easy to install and hang  It comes with instruction sheets and every bolt needed.  I mounted it into a wood stud.  Highly recommended.  I bought a second one for an older LCD.  Be certain not to overload it.  The one drawback is that the TV plate might block some of the HDMI or other sockets.
5,"In the process of turning our master bedroom into a fortress of solitude for my wife, we decided to mount our&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-TC-L32X2-32-Inch-720p-LCD-HDTV/dp/B0039213XY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV</a>&nbsp;on the wall, above the dresser, to save some space. (You can never have enough dresser space for displaying tchotchkes, amirite, fellas?) My wife wanted a fixed wall mount but I thought the viewing angle required some articulation. (In hindsight, fixed would have worked, too.) This unit was highly rated and the price was right. Sold.  The installation was straightforward and fairly simple. The only point at which I needed some help was in balancing the TV while I attached it to the arm; otherwise it was all me. I think it looks great; my wife says it reminds her of being in the hospital. (Sorry, Honey.) When we mount the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Panasonic-VIERA-TC-P42S30-42-Inch-1080p-Plasma-HDTV/dp/B004M8SBOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Panasonic VIERA TC-P42S30 42-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV</a>&nbsp;in the living room, I'll definitely use a flat mount.  You could spend four times this much on an articulating TV mount, but I don't see why you would."
5,"I trust SanDisk to deliver high end products which is why I don't mind spending a bit more for SanDisk products. I had issues with other brands writing to disk (when used with a phone) and I had one card fry on me. One could put blame on device for frying a card but card should be able to tolerate high temps, as does SanDisk. Highly recommended product, specifically for Samsung Galaxy S3 phones. Cheers."
5,"This tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad. Serves more than one purpose ...while its primary function is reading. The original nook is a whole family experience. Its size and durability give the nook, nook color, and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity. This is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school. She wanted something to read her books on, and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for her.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barnes-and-Noble-NOOK-eBook-Reader-WiFi-only-Black-White/dp/1400532620/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader (WiFi only) [ Black & White </a>]"
5,"I use the card with my Galaxy S3 and it works like a charm. The size allows me to store my music in a higher quality than i  would have otherwise been able to, and it's great not constantly having to delete stuff from my phone for it not to fill up.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that I can't install apps to the memory card. This is has nothing to do with the card though. It's just the way Samsung made the phone.  All in all a must for someone who uses their smartphone for what it's worth."
5,"The battery lasts much longer, too. I had mine at 100% charged and it lasted for about twelve hours of playing time (with the brightness turned to low). I have the Netflix app and I can watch the videos perfectly. It's crystal clear."
4,"I received the mount, which was well packaged for shipping.  The installation instructions were Moderately clear.  No issues following them, they were just a little disjointed depending on the wall surface you were installing on.  My shipment had a mis-cut piece, and was missing 4 screws.  I contacted the Manufacturer, and they shipped me a replacement part and screws the very next day (Shipped out of Texas, so normal mailing times applied)  I like how the Mount fits together, and I easily mounted my 60lbs TV by myself.  The part that attaches to the TV has a hook that will hold the TV on the Arm till you bolt it on.  It's very adjustable, and pushes almost flush with the wall.  I'm very happy, but took one star for the miscut piece."
5,"If I need to order another, this will be the one.  I used this to mount a TV to the wall in my basement and it allows me to pull the tv out from the wall and turn it towards my desk so I can watch TV while working on the PC, nearly a 90 degree angle.  My TV is only a 32"" and I could see that this would work up to a 40"" or so, but if you don't need to turn the TV 90 degrees, you could get by with a larger TV."
5,"I have purchased this mount twice now - one for my bedroom TV, and one for my living room TV.  The bedroom TV is a 35"" LCD, and the TV in the living room is a 55"" LED.  (Surprisingly enough, they both weigh 50 pounds...)  This mount works very well for both of them.  It's relatively simple to install - you just need to find a stud and screw the support in to it.  (I will admit that my bedroom TV has been attached not to a wall stud, but a jury-rigged support brace on a cabinet.  It's still there and attached after 6 months.)  I will say that the joints in the arms are quite stiff - it can take a little muscle to move the TV.  But I think I prefer that - it certainly doesn't feel flimsy, and it stays wherever I put it.  A tip for would-be purchasers: make sure your TV supports this mount.  You can usually find your compatible VESA patterns in your user's manual.  (Or a quick online search, perhaps.)  As I often say - when buying online, it pays to do your homework."
5,"Cute! Bought 2 for my daughter. I thought it was for instant camera photos because it was on the ""suggested items"" where I bought a instant camera case.  Oh well, she likes it so I'm ok with that.  They are nice."
4,"Got this to replace a Peerless Paramount wall mount when I got my new TV.  Let me start off by saying it works as advertised.  But that won't get you 5 stars.  The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall. Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).  They do get kudos for providing all the screws for all VESA types as well as a regular and an Allen wrench. Three stars for ease of installation, five stars for usability, for a combined four stars.  Make sure you get help when installing."
5,I really liked this book.  The characters were well developed.  The pace kept my interest and the story line was interesting.  It was a mix of romance and story and it kept me entertained.
1,What I received is more of a butterfly looking plate And therefore doesn't fit my tv without covering my inputs.  I am going to have to return it unless my dad can't use at his house.  Really bummed as I measured and thought I covered all my bases.  The item pictured looks like is would fit fine :(
5,"This is the third ebook reader I've used and definitely the best.  The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.  I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.  The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.  Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.  There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).  I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.  I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N store.  Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.  So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)  UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!  I emailed B&N Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!  I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!"
3,"I was hoping for more here than what you find in the officially sanctioned ""iWork '09 Portable Genius"" books that Apple puts out. Perhaps something less propriety would have have been nice. But all I saw in this book was more of the same. There are more pictures, which are of some help, but because ""My Mac Book"" sticks solely to the Snow Leopard operating system, you won't even get help with things like the Pages word processor. Since IPhoto is part of iLife, you don't get any help there either. Exactly what do you get help with anyway? Oh, iCal (which is largely intuitive), making files, working with Mail, using AirPort, and, get this, MobileMe--which is a paid, subscription service. Shilling for MobileMe should not be in a basics book like this, but there you are. It also goes into detail with Genius on iTunes. Genius is another of Apple's little features that is really nothing more than enticement to buy more music. So, here again the book is pandering again to Apple's sales dept.  Did I learn anything from this book? I wish I had. Most of it is so basic that I knew the ins and outs already. For the stuff that really had me stumped, such as a keychain disaster, it couldn't help me with at all. I found a fix somewhere else.  I suppose this book is better than nothing for rank beginners, but there are better ones out there. The official Apple books are definitely the better buy."
5,"Can't beat the price on Amazon.  This is a San Disk product.  I have used San Disk product for years without any issues.  This is also, the super fast read and write card.  You won't be disappointed with this one."
5,"We bought this for our 8 year old who has a great deal of trouble falling asleep at night. It has the perfect amount of reading light to allow him to read without waking his younger brother and it is so light! They have a great selection of books for his age range and though the battery says it will last a month I think t was anticipating only and hour of reading a day. I had to recharge today so it lasted 12 days with him reading almost 2 hours a day. Best gift we have bought him ever, hands down."
5,"I found tablets and phones lack the battery life and quiet simplicity of this type of specialised product.  Forget checking email, listening to audio or constant distractions. This ereader is purely a reading machine. The text is clearer than a laser printed page and the capacity of 32GB micro SD card means accessibility to 10,000's of books.  As with my Samsung table I found PDF viewings unsatisfactory and even maps in epubs were a disappointment.  Another issue is that, without a US credit card billing address, B&N will not let you use your account so I have had to store by own epubs in the machine and find them elsewhere.  The unit is easy to operate and had a claimed battery life of up to two months. It is easily charged from a micro USB connection and files can easily be copied from a PC.  The crystal clear text and easy touch or button navigation make reading a pleasure. There is only a minuscule delay when turning pages. All in all I am delighted by the unit which is good value for something that holds practically my entire library."
5,Need I say more?  Ok I will: The price is right.  If your primary goal is READING ACTUAL WORDS (What a thought!!!) then this e-reader is an excellent choice. The GlowLight is particularly helpful if reading in bed or in situations where the device is being backlit (such as sunlight through a window).
5,"This is a great TV wall mount. After reading the reviews decided to purchase for a new Samsung 32"" for bedroom.  The mount was easy to assemble and mount to wall. Although instructions call for finding a wall stud to mount, the hardware package includes large dry wall anchors and screws.  I opted to purchase ""Toggler"" high performance drywall anchors/toggle bolts.  These cost a couple bucks for a package of two at any big box store and they hold up to 240 lbs each.  There was no stud near where I needed to mount the bracket for the TV mount, so I used four toggler bolts, which was probably overkill.  The TV itself easily mounted to the wall bracket with hardware provided.  TV was on the wall and in use in less than 30 minutes.  Really like the 15 degree angle, which works great in a bedroom.  For the price you can't beat this mount.  Although I will probably never use the articulating arm, it is great for adding/moving cables from behind the TV by simply pulling it away from the wall.  Would highly recommend."
5,"I have had this mount for about 4 years now and it has held up well. I love the fact that I can easily view my TV from almost any angle in my room. Whether I'm laying in bed, or at my computer desk this mount allows me to adjust the viewing angle to where I can see it perfectly. For the most part, I keep the mount completely retracted and it looks great. It is almost flush with only about an inch or two gap from the wall. I would highly recommend this mount to anyone looking for a versatile TV mount!"
5,"I originally bought this for a Sony 40"" TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42"" instead. I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs. I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it. (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.  Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine. Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims. I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install. Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem. The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force. Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.  I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises. An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount. If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it). If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount."
5,This is one of the better one's out there.  With the adapters I can't imagine any TV this would not work with.  I am actually going to buy another one.
4,"I purchased 4 of these for various sized TV's from a 37"" to a 55"".  A couple of things to be cognizant of:  First, make sure you center the mount on the wall in a closed position and look where the TV will actually be when hung and second, make sure you have a helper!  PROS: Inexpensive No problem once up  CONS: Difficult to mount Instructions are not the best  Now that all the TV's are mounted I'm grateful the task is done and glad I purchased them... but that's not what I was saying when I was mounting them.  It was a challenge to see who would win at times but well worth the savings."
5,"Put this in my S4, works great. Used my laptop to transfer all music and files from old SD to this new one. Did have only 8gb before but I wanted to make my S4 an mp3 player also so I bought a larger SD card. Have been using this card for the past few months and have found nothing wrong with it."
4,"Love this product! I bought this for a 46"" tv and plan on ordering another for a 27"".  Installation was fairly smooth. Took my husband and I about 20 minutes maybe. We weren't timing it but it didn't take long. Actually, the hardest part of the installation was lifting the tv onto it. The directions are pretty straight forward, at least we didn't get confused. It comes out of the box almost completely put together and you actually have to take it partially take it apart to conduct the install.  NOTE: the tv will swivel 15 degrees to each side. As in if you were to try to rotate the tv in 360 circle. We took the whole thing down thinking that we installed it crooked but the part that attaches to the back of the tv is meant to be adjusted for this and that is what we had to correct."
5,UPDATE: I have now have purchased 3 of these for work and home and with the lighter LED TV's this is a perfect mount for most sizes - this is a great mount - easy to install - easy to use - easy to expand - easy to mount TVs. I haven't found another one that is so useful - even if you don't need it to extend this is still a great mount  --- I guess for the price I was expecting something cheaper but I was quite surprised. It was easy to install and works for what I need it for - it may be over kill for a 22 inch LED LCD TV but I like the way it can be moved around.
5,"I have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio.  It holds a 27"" LCD monitor (about 20-25lbs).  It's been up for a week and I don't expect that it will fall down anytime soon."
5,"The B&N Nook is a great device. The hardware in it makes sure there is no lag or waits while watching videos, reading books, or surfing the web. The builtin apps are great, as well as the overall layout and options. The major drawback is the inability to load 3rd party apps...but roll back to firmware 1.4.0 and load all you want before upgrading. Or root it (although Amazon Instant Video will not work after rooting)."
3,"Obviously the premise of this book first struck me as a knockoff of The Devil Wears Prada. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to discover that this was not another tale of assistants putting up with impossibly awful bosses; rather, Taylor's boss was not the problem - she's the kind of classy lady you would want to work for - instead it was Taylor's fellow assistant who turned out to be the complete psycho.  Taylor's character wasn't wildly appealing, but the story was funny, fast-paced and truly captured the lives of many assistants. I was interested, I wanted Taylor to prevail over her seemingly-insane roommate and her shallow judgemental co-workers - even when the story took some unrealistic turns, I was rooting for Taylor to win. I definitely recommend this book as a quick and fun summer read."
4,"I don't come across many novels where the subject is not heavily covered in today's Christian market, but the author does it with such strength and ability to craft a memorable story. Not only was this story captivating, it left me with memorable characters and a story line that will resound with me for time to come. NOT A SPARROW FALLS is not a fast read. It requires a willingness to really delve into it, but once I entered the story world, I couldn't leave. The situations the heroine found herself in were heartbreaking and anxious. I loved the love story. It wasn't overt or edgy, but it was sweet and captivating. How I longed to see it resolved in the end. There were so many different threads that made up the tapestry of this story. From a family suffering from the loss of their mother, to a young woman running from a wealth of bad decisions, to a drug ravaged young man and the old woman who prays for them all. I would give this book five stars, but I am giving it four because there was a theology issue, I do not agree with, namely once save always saved. But aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It resounded and connected with me. I will not soon forget these characters or their story. I want to thank Jim at Bethany House for my copy of this book to review."
5,"Strong, E A S Y to install, fits any flat screen bolt configuration and they give you at least 15 different screws so no hunting through the hardware section at LOWES!"
5,"If you're not looking for a high quality Android tablet with tons of apps and lots of power, and are only looking for a perfectly sized screen to read books and watch videos, then this is the tablet for you.  The screen is great quality so videos and books look splendid.  Netflix runs smoothly as does YouTube, so when it comes to that aspect this tablet definitely doesn't disappoint.  It's also the perfect size, at least in my opinion, for reading books, which is does well.  All-in-all, it doesn't have everything, but with what it does have it performs spectacularly."
5,"Just got this refurb Nook as my first ebook reader, and I am very happy.  Like any other refurb electronic device I've bought in the past, the only way to tell this was a refurb was by looking at the receipt.  Otherwise, it looks brand-new, perfect finish and screen, and so far, it works fine.  Downloaded a couple free books from the B&N Store, a bunch of Project Gutenberg books, something from the Google bookstore, and a PDF, and they have all worked fine.  Even tried out the web browser.  It works, but with the slow refresh rate of the e-ink screen and the small size of the color LCD, it's more of a novelty than something you would use as a primary internet device.  Unfortunately, the browser doesn't support downloading, so you can't go the Project Gutenberg website and download a book directly from the site to the Nook.  Hopefully that gets changed in the future, that would be nice to be able to do!  But this is not a make-or-break issue, just a convenience I would like.  Otherwise, I'm very happy with this purchase!"
5,"I was going to deploy to my third deployment to Iraq in 2011 and I wanted some way to read all my books. As you may know, space is precious when you're talking about military gear. We were very strict on what we could or could not bring on the deployment. Also I need something that could go a long time on a single charge. None of the full tablets were going to cut it and than I discovered the paper white. It claims that you can go several weeks on a single charge (or was it months) I can't remember since it's been son long. There were times on my last deployments where we went almost a month without any electricity. After a successful deployment I can defiantly say that this nook proved it was up to the task. I don't think I charged it more than twice and the second charge was just because I had the time and means. The tablet was also very well built. As you may know, Iraq has lots of sand. There were even a few times where I dropped the tablet in the sand. The device kept on trucking and did not give up.  After my deployment I put it away in a drawer and forgot about it until I discovered it after I recently moved to my new town house. I would recommend this for anyone who want's a cheaper tablet for reading and does not mind not having sound or video. I currently have the finances and the means to get a much fancier and expensive tablet but I still love using my paper white. I do a lot of reading in the evening and I like how my eyes don't get strained from looking at a lit screen. I'm the type of person who can sit down and read for hours and hours."
1,Did not work at all. Seems like they may be tryinig to offload non working electronics on people and hope most don't bother to request a refund. Took an inordinately long amount of time to receive the product as well.
5,"A lot in a small package, what else is there to say, it is working fine so far in 2 different Sansa MP3 players, 72GB in a Clip Zip ...."
4,"I was very curious if it's really genuine or just pretending to be because it seems like almost every cable and charger sold in Amazon is labeled as being from the manufacturer.  Anyway, mine did not come in a B&N Nook box, it was in a tiny zip lock bag with a piece of ordinary paper obviously printed with a low-resolution inkjet printer that explains what Nook devices will work with it and what will not.  First thing I did was to put it side-by-side with the original charger that came with my Nook 8.9 HD+.  It was exactly the same size, shape, color and weight.  The only difference was the printed details in the charger.  The print was brighter and crisper in the original, but it was also decent in the new one I purchased.  Also, the QR code in the original was missing in the new one.  Finally, the hinge mechanism in the folding prongs was a little different, but the ""feel"" of folding and unfolding the prong was exactly the same.  With the USB cable, there was virtually no difference whatsoever.  So, I finally plugged it in and the tablet immediately recognized it and charged.  I honestly do not see any other difference.  If it came in an original Nook box, I would definitely proclaim it to be original.  Maybe it was from a company that bought them in bulk (it definitely looked brand new) and resold it, or maybe it was from the same China factory who manufactured them for B&N and decided to sell units outside their agreement.  Who knows?"
5,"Google is on to something here, but without a little luck, I would not have known about it. I now own 2 chrome books (one for my wife and one for me) and find the experience delightful. In trying to learn and become more productive with it, I have searched the web for how-to articles, etc. Quite by accident, I came across ""The Chrome Book."" It is well written, very informative, and a real good overview of the ""operating system."" It also treats some of the higher level uses. This was my best find yet, and one that I am buying as a reference book. I just hope Google keeps going with this concept with enhancements, improvements, and more advertising. Again, well written book and on target!"
5,This is the second one I bought (this was for my mother).  The only draw back to this is not being able to access Google Play store.  You have to get your apps throught the Barnes and Noble store.  Most that are comprable with what you get on full android are not free and they don't get the updates as often.
5,"Barnes and Noble hit one out of the park with this ereader! compact, great e-ink infrared touch screen, microsd card slot, two-month battery life, wifi, support for pdf and epub, and best of all, running Android!  the STR has already been rooted, and handily runs Android and a host of goodie apps - but even if you don't want to crack your unit, you'll still enjoy a nice ereader and simple-to-use interface:  - fast, responsive, and crystal clear screen - even in sunlight - touch right or left sides of screen to page forwards or backwards - OR - use the hardware buttons on the top sides of the frame - use 'shelves' to organize your titles - view titles as icons or in a list - insert bookmarks, notes - look up words instantly with its built-in dictionary - change fonts, font sizes on the fly - purchase titles via wifi or copy from your computer - and much more...  no ereader is perfect, but this one comes close; i held off buying one until the market provided lots of choices - and the STR is the one i've been waiting for!  btw, if you have an ereader, you should also get the free cross-platform ebook app, calibre - it is an *essential* ereader companion, and can be used to convert DRM-free ebooks to nearly any format for nearly all ereaders, include the new Nook Simple Touch!"
5,What a fantastic read! Enjoyed everything about this book. Highly recommend it. So great to read something that is totally unpredictable. I'm sure I will reread someday and I rarely do that.
5,"I was pretty doubtful about whether an ebook reader was worth it, but this nook surpassed my expectations. I love the simplicity, and the small size makes it perfect for travelling. The material its made of makes it stay in your hand well, and the features it has is just right for me - not to fancy, but not lacking either. My only complaint is the fact that you can't use the dictionary on pdf books, but I remedied that easily by using software on my computer to convert my pdfs into epub before putting them on the nook. All in all, this is the best purchase I've made in a while - definitely worth it!"
5,"I read all the reviews and decided to buy this Barnes and Noble Nook for my Grandson for Christmas it was used but with original box and accesories  through EZ CORPS!!!  And I'm happy to say this Barnes and Noble is the best I ever invested in the picture and color is beautiful. Let's put it this way my niece that has the kindle was checking out the Barnes and Noble nook and compared it to her kindle said that the Barnes and Noble Nook has a clear picture than her kindle and more apps!!! And I told her I did my homework and looked this Nook up and it had the best reputation as far as for a kid,Young teen, Best nook ever invested in money and used at that but I will only order used if the item says like New with original Box with Accesories . And  I will only order anything used through EZ CORPS!! Best company to ever order anything from on Amazon fast professional customer service and love there shipping and handling !! And there all there used products are tested before selling which is a plus. I would Highly recommend this company any day to any one , Friends,Family,etc,Yes this Barnes & Noble Nook is well worth ordering used or new. Thank you Kristen Cates."
5,This was a great book. I couldn't put it down. Can not wait for this author to release his next book. Excellent to the point writing style. I don't enjoy drawn out descriptions of every little thing. This guy doesn't do that. This book moves right along. Great story and exciting! Thanx Dale!
5,"Nice specs with nice screen. Not worth the price with just the stock operating system, might as well save the bucks and buy the cheaper color model. You cannot use the larger 16gb internal memory to load your own files as the bad boys at B&N restricts your access to only 1gb of that memory. UPDATE: Because of the unhappy owners B&N will relax this restriction when you take the unit into their store and reserved space will be changed so you get 8gb free space. As is, the unit is SEVERELY crippled from making full use of its outstanding specs. Turn this baby into a great Android tablet by ""rooting"" it - easily and painlessly done by buying one of those SD card based kits. I got a 32 GB card with the root kit and I now have full access to Android apps with the ability to revert back to stock is if desired. You can now get all these capabilities on a really good performing tablet for well under $130 (like new used) but remember you get a unit that's a generation old and doesn't have bluetooth, gps, and hdmi out like most other newer tablets have."
5,"This device is small enough to fit in my purse , so it is always handy for that long bus ride home and for reading on those nights when I can't seem to sleep."
5,"I was skeptical of ordering these chargers as replacements, but the reviews were so positive I decided to give them a try.  They came days earlier than they were expected (an added treat) and immediately began charging the Nook.  I couldn't be happier.  As of this writing, if there were 10 stars to give, I would gladly give them."
5,First time I've EVER had a remote that needed no programming whatsoever so I have to give it bragging rights.  All the other 8780Ls I've had certainly had to be set up first.  Yes I wish it was Silver or White or some color that would permit its buttons to be more easily read but its thinner in hand than the ATLAS OCAP 5-Device Cable Remote Control 1056B03 so its the best thing I can find for a Samsung DVR with Samsung TV on the TWC system in NY.
5,"This is good product compared to its price. I'm using it for watching video, writing documents, and web searching. It's perfect for my needs, and I upload CM 1.0, so now I'm using it with Android... It's so good. :-)"
5,"After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.  As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.  I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.  The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.  I highly recommend the Nook. With BN updates coming as quick as they are, I think this device is proving to be THE superior ereader."
5,"I originally bought a refurbished First Edition Nook on here for around $30.00 and then I got this one for myself after setting her up and going through a little learning curve as this was my first e-reader experience. I ADORE IT ! Now, the glowlight is essential if you want to read in bed with a wife or partner and not wake them up with a nightstand lamp...this is PERFECT for that. We have yet to use the Barnes & Noble book purchase options because we use ours entirely for checking out books from the library and it is awesome because my Wife works and if a book she has checked out is late and runs out, all she has to do is plug it in to the PC, log in to the library, and check it out again. Incredibly simple and convenient!. Just one thing to consider, setting up takes a little doing at first whether you plan to buy books from B&N or check out books from a library via the internet. In our case we had to do 3 things: 1) Register the Nook with Barnes and Noble, 2) Install Adobe Digital Editions (ADE), and 3) Go to the local public library (ours is attached to the Clark County Public Library district here in Las Vegas) and open up an account and get a library id/card to be able to log in with from home. ...Once that's in place, all you have to do is plug your nook up to the computer, log into the library, download their e-book, drag it to the nook and read ! Our library's check out time can be anywhere from 3 to 7 days and as long as no one got in behind you to reserve your book, you can just re-check it out. === [Note that these last 2 items are not necessary if you only plan to use B&Noble...and don't forget they often offer free content too, as well as samplers!] ... Now just a few things...the Nook First Edition lets you more dynamically play with fonts whereas this one has preset font size options but that's still quite alright..but > this < one lets you highlight a word and it has a dictionary right there for you ! Well, if you're of the mindset that you don't quite want to give up the tactile experience of a physical book, I'm telling you that you will quickly overcome that.  My wife has read thousands of books in her life and was an aspiring Librarian in her youth, but once she started on one of these, you couldn't PRY it out of her hands without serious trouble lemmie tell ya...and I've talked with some of the most resistant Curmudgeons of age 50 and above who tried it and got the same story. Get yourself a Nook.  That's my advise. ....time to get back to reading now.  I'm working on the classics that I missed in my life and George Orwell's _1984_ awaits ! Be well, Al Nance"
5,"MY WIFE ADORES THIS PRODUCT !! It was our household's first e-reader. There IS a little learning curve at first and expect to need a household pc to talk to it via a usb micro (not MINI) data cable WITH DATA capability (some usb cables are just charge-only) and if you get a used deal on one without a usb micro data+power ability, you are looking at up to $20.00 (unless you get one cheaper taking a risk on a crappier cable). --- Only thing is it's hard for someone whose disabled with touching or vision issues to use... though you can increase font size, the rare occasion you have to type something out it's kinda small but that doesn't happen often on the nook itself. ---- She uses hers mainly to check things out from the Clark County Library District in Las Vegas.  Once we registered with the Library, we installed Adobe Digital Editions which is the digital rights management... that took some doing but once in place, you tell the ADE of the nook you have, authorize it, and then from that point on anytime you want to check out a library book you simply go to their site, check out the electronic version which comes into your computer where the ADE recognizes it and outputs it to your nook. After x amount of days...when the checkout time expires, the file disables itself and you either get another book from the library or re check-in/check-out the same one for another x days. It makes the public library a whole new experience and that's great because, guess what...your tax dollars paid for it !  and the author gets their cut too. .... Win-win all around. ...We've never bought an e-book from barnes and noble yet, and you do have to register the nook with them at first though you don't have to put in a credit card, but that step is probably skippable it's just handy because if you want help from b&n they'll want you to at least register the product with them..not a big deal and it's one-time during your initial set-up procedures (and that's the one time you need to use the aforementioned little hard to type on 'typewriter' display. Happy Nooking (P.S.  as a bad pun, I told my wife that if The 3 Stooges owned it, it would be a Nook-Nook-Nook... but I was frowned at.  Guess it's funnier if Curley is your favorite stooge.  I digress :)  )"
5,"I use this arm to mount my 39 inch Vizio. I'm surprised my TV has a 100x100 mount thingy. It can tilt left and right, up and down. I do wish it swiveled the TV so that it wasn't crooked. When the bolts get loose, my TV looks crooked."
5,Works great and is so much cheaper than the more expensive versions at the Big box stores. It is super easy to install yourself too. You just need a drill and a ratchet set to get it into the stud (oh yea a stud finder too).
3,"Writers who crank out as many books as Mr. Rain have always amazed me.  I am also amazed that mostly women read his books.  Nothing wrong with reading about blood suckers and ex-football players right guys?  Okay, I digress, back to the Knighthorse book review.  I enjoy sarcasm.  I employ it often and well.  Reading a book involving mayhem, murder and sarcasm is quite enjoyable.  I have purchased the 3-pack of Knighthorse and found a recurring theme in each book.  If the next book also has the sameness, I will be disappointed. I did enjoy the three pack."
5,"This is a very classic and unusual photo album, showing a camera that was used so long ago. It also keeps shut because of the loop and button. Doesn't hold a lot of pictures but just enough to carry some memories with you."
5,It really works with Samsung's Newest Tablet.  But first you should reformat the card to fat32.  The tablet itself doesn't seem to be able to make this process. I formated it with my Galaxy S2 and then inserted it into the tablet.  Hope it helps other people.
5,"Received this item quickly and well packaged (But not so well that I was infuriated trying to open it) Everything was in perfct order. Strong, handsome appearance. Installation Kit is perfectly in order and gives a ton of options for different senarios.  Couldn't possibly be happier with this product."
5,"I have a 47"" TV and had no place to put it in my bed room. With this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging. Very easy to install, came with all hard ware."
2,"Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units."
5,This is perfect for my MS Surface Pro.  I have the 128 Gb Surface Pro and this adds half as much more memory!  I placed it in the slot and it immediately recognized the card.  No problems!
4,"The mount is very sturdy and installation was a breeze.  However, I do have a few gripes:  Stiff: re-positioning the TV can be difficult because the joints are so tight, that moving the TV around on the mount isn't very easy (this may be due to the rigidness).  Tilt: the up and down tilt function is limited to 10-15, so don't install it too high up.  Cable management:  The mount comes with cheap plastic clips that you can guide your wires through.  However, they're loose and don't seem to help too much.  Not a big deal."
5,"I got tired of the remote being on the wrong side of the bed. I was going to buy a generic remote when I got the idea to look for the real thing.  For a few bucks more I got this one. It is the same one as Time Warner gives you, works exactly the same, don't have to relearn anything."
5,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com. In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!  Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.  The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.  Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!  This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!  Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks."
5,"this is a fantastic wall mount.  Very sturdy and very well constructed.  I'm using it to mount a 55"" led tv and it shows no signs of stress from the weight.  Works very easily and I can swing the TV out and in any direction with no effort at all.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality at such a reasonable price.  Get it,  you won't regret it."
5,"Had major surgery, which left me having to spend a lot of time in bed.  Needed something to mount a new flat screen on to help with recovery and this did the trick.  That was almost two years ago and it's still going strong.  No complaints here!  Recommend without hesitation."
5,"Nightingale is a former police negotiator working as a private detective. Why he's a FORMER cop is explained in painful detail in the introductory chapters, but I don't want to spoil the the story with too many details. His life now is much different and Nightingale is a changed man. Most of his casework is unfaithful spouses, but it pays the bills most of the time. His current hum drum life of drudgery all changes when he's told that he has inherited a large mansion from a deceased father he never knew existed. This isn't the life Nightingale asked for or ever wished for.  ""Your going to hell Nightingale"" or is he. what follows is an unorthodox tale about devil worship and demons from the perspective of an astute cop and non-believer. The story challenges our understanding of right and wrong, while also exploring themes about the meaning of life and the inevitability of death. It also ponders whether who we are is influenced by the environment we grew up in, or is dictated by birth,  Nightingale learns that there is a lot about his past, and his life that was different from what he knew growing up. This well written story was riveting, and had equal parts paranormal and police procedural. Nightingale is a flawed human being with his heart in the right place. he is helped by a secretary, who though young and attractive, is ultimately overqualified for the position she works. Why does she work for me, Nightingale wonders on more than one occasion. Their relationship in this book is one of the more interesting elements of the story. Whether it will evolve into a romance is uncertain, though it is clear they both have feelings for each other. He is also helped by a cop buddy friend from his former life.  I don't want to give too much of the story away, just know that I found Nightingales journey of discovery to be fascinating and the philosophical elements interesting and provocative. It's not just a story about self-discovery, but a journey into the unknown and uncertain. It's also a story that is at times heart-wrenching. Regardless, I look forward to the second book."
5,We needed a wall mount for a 32 TV that was going to be in the screened in porch.  This was one of the brands recommended by the guy that was going to install out wall mount.  I cant speak to the ease or difficulty of installation but it looks great and we can swivel it if necessary for best viewing angle.  It's also pretty sleek so it doesn't butt out too much.  It arrived quickly and it didn't take the installer long but of course he was a professional.  Looks great!
4,"I thought this was a great value for a wall mount.  I have installed a 32 inch tv in my bathroom with this unit.  It worked well with the Visio TV that I bought.  It looked it it could accomodate many other tvs because there were a variety of holes on the mounting bracket.  Is it the best quality ever, no.  It is decent quality, and it worked well for me."
5,This is perfect for what I needed it for. I can move the screen from side to side if I need to and I don't have the TV sitting on my desk.....
4,"Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!  Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).  I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?  Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.  Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.  Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...  The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.  I hope this review is useful. :-)"
5,"Good story. Can't wait to get to the next book in this series. I love discovering an author for the first time and finding they have written a series, something to look forward to."
1,"Amamax sent me the wrong ram to start with, I mean the numbers weren't even close to being the same as the one in the picture or the listing. I tried it anyway to see if it might be another brands substitute and my machine wouldn't even try to boot with this ram in it. The packaging was a joke, they dropped it in a ziplock bag and put  that in a bubble envelope none of which offered much protection but by some miracle it did make it without getting broken. When I emailed them about the issue they took several days to get back to me and when they did they didn't even offer to replace it, they just told me to return it. I ask you what the hell kind of service is that? Emails take forever out of this place and when you are lucky enough to get one it's far from being friendly. I will NEVER buy another item from AMAMAX again EVER!"
5,the nook color is a great tablet. it sometimes is very slow but it is still a good tablet. i have dropped it a few times and it is still okay.
4,"Would love to give it 5 stars, but the ONE and only thing missing from this is that the charging indicator light doesn't work.  The biggest positive about this is that the connection to the Nook itself, is MUCH more ""beefy"" than the standard Nook charging cable.  B&N should have to supply each and every Nook owner with one of these free of cost due to their incredibly poor design of the standard cable that comes with the unit itself.  This is at least the fourth charger cable we have bought and I am hoping that it is the last."
5,"I've used the Nook Touch and the Kindle Touch/Kindle Paperwhite extensively and the Nook is the best. Why? I'm convinced that if anyone prefers the Kindle its because they've never tried the Nook. Or they have friends that used Kindle and don't want to venture out on their own.  First the Nook feels better. It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident. Some might not like it because you have to push pretty hard, but that's by design.  Second the platform is user friendly and great to navigate.  Third the font choices are better and you get several more to choose from. Plus the size options all make sense. For instance on the Kindle the couple smallest font sizes are so small I can't see why anyone would use them and to me it's a waste.  Fourth the buttons are all well placed.  Fifth there are no ads and you can even upload your own pictures.  Go try one today. I'm fairly confident you'll love it.....unless you don't."
5,"I bought this SD microCard for my GoPro Silver, and it has worked perfectly.  The 64 GB storage is large enough that my camera will run out of battery long before the card fills up.  Neither the camera nor my Lenovo Laptop have had any issues reading the card whatsoever.  Overall, this was an excellent purchase and I recommend it to anybody in the market."
5,"I really enjoyed this book. Jack Nightingale is totally likeable and hilarious character. He is a skilled hostage negotiator but that seems to go south for him.  Then he turns to being a private investigator. Soon people around him die with their last message being ""you are going to hell Jack Nightingale"".  This book is almost impossible to put down and I finished it in just a couple of days. I highly recommend this book. Just enough of the supernatural to make it chilling. Well done!"
5,These are fantastic.  I purchased one because I had a new flatscreen and paid someone 60$ to install it.  After watching how fast he did it I purchased two more and hung the other two myself!  Please note I have ZERO skills.  This takes less than thirty minutes to hang and really moves smoothly.
5,The transfer rates on this micro sd card are fantastic. I have it on my cell phone which gives me the storage capacity to add any type of files without running out of space. If you are the type of person that likes to carry your phone with all types of information than I would highly recommend this micro sd card for you.
5,"Great Mount, so many areas of articulation. This was a great gift idea my mother loves it. I have purchased two of them and they are sturdy and give a touch of class to every room you put them in. A must have any video file or those who want to save space in a bedroom or office."
5,"I have several of these and they have never failed me. I shoot In Turkey and the UAE (Dubai), and need a lot of memory. A 64 GB memory micro disk will hold 2600 photos, and a lot of video."
5,it was so easy to install.  the instructions were simple and so was the process.  i was putting off the project for fear.  i should have hung the TV long ago.
5,This is mounted in a doorway between two rooms in my basement with a 40 inch TV attached to it.  I can move it to either room and still keep the doorway open plenty wide enough to pass through.  Perfect for my needs.
5,The little lady sleeps with it almost every night. She loves the reader and is very happy with it so far. Without the glow light or connected to wifi it can go weeks. She uses the glow light at night (every night) and still gets days of use without charging. Scored major points for this purchase.
4,"I highly recommend Elephant Run, by Roland Smith. Elephant Run is set during World War II in Burma, which is located in Southern Asia. The main character is 14-year-old Nick Freestone who lived in London, England. After Nick's parents' apartment was destroyed during the German bombing of London, Nick's mother and father both decided it would be safest to send Nick to Burma to stay with his dad on a plantation to get away from the bombing.  After a few days in Burma, the Japanese forces attacked their plantation, taking Nick's father as a prisoner of war, leaving Nick to stay with the rest of the Burmese who were given the choir of building an aircraft hanger for the Japanese. Nick finds a way to escape with the help of a Burmese monk of high importance. The monk's niece joined them on their escape. Once they had left the plantation without being spotted, they hitched a ride on a couple of elephants and rode them over to the prison site where Nick's dad was being held.  Thanks to the help of a Japanese friend, Nick's dad was able to escape, too. While all four of them were escaping, two guards who were patrolling the prison gates spotted them. The elephant that had assisted Nick on his journey to the prison camp saw that the guards were wearing tiger pelts around their necks. The elephants, thinking that they were a threat because of the tiger pelts draped around their necks, charged the guards and killed them. Nick, his dad, and the monk's niece all were able to find refuge from the war in Australia.  I thought that Elephant Run was a great book.  It was very suspenseful and it held my attention all the way through. I think that anyone would enjoy this book, especially people who are interested in learning about World War II."
4,"Good, strong mount and quality hardware. Includes all the different size screws required to attach to TV if yours doesn't have them (or if you lost them).  There is just the right amount of resistance in the joints for it to stay where you want it but still easy to move around.  I mounted a shelf above the TV to get the cable box out of the way and avoid having to run a long HDMI cable through the wall. I took a star only because I received a different unit than the one pictured, It has 2 thick arms, rather than the 2-1 that is shown.  Honestly I think what I got is more attractive, but I believe that Amazon vendors should not substitute different products without authorization.  My unit also did not come with the extender arms in the picture, it has a mounting plate with all of the VESA mounting holes in the correct configuration.  My TV is 26"" so it fit perfectly.  I am sure my 55"" would fit on it too, but I have a different mounting configuration for that one."
5,"Amazing card, I popped it into my ASUS Prime and was recognized instantly. Plays my 1080p movies without any hiccups or interruptions. So for less than the price of a 32 GB iPad2 I now have... A 96GB quad core monster. If you have a Prime, makes no sense NOT to get one. VERY pleased, as soon as I get my keybaord dock, will be getting a 128GB card that will put my Prime at 224GB and still cost me less than a iPad 64GB."
5,"I ordered this item after reading many reviews that it would work on my HTC Rezound.  People reported that a 64 GB card will work on the Rezound, despite that the manufacturer says 32 GB is supported.  64 GB works due to the fact of firmware updates.  When using this card, Android will think that it is broken and needs to be reformatted.  I let the phone format the card and it worked!  Just to note, even though the card is not technically fully supported on the Rezound - meaning that you won't get the full 30 MB/s write speed, you still get a ton of space for a pretty good price.  Last to say, I think any new Android devices running the lastest version of Gingerbread and needless to say Ice Cream Sandswich - this card show work fine.  Please make sure to read the user reviews on your device."
4,Got them and only 2 of them worked. company called me after the feedback and told me they would send me a refund. The 2 that are working are doing fine. I like the lighted feature a lot for the night time.
5,Needed it for a microecon lecture class. Once set to the a bases'a frequency you won't need to set it again once the receiver is on due to it doing it automatically which is helpful.
5,"This item is all you would ever want on a micro sd. I have used it on a canon rebel t3i (with the sd adapter), a samsung galaxy s3, a galaxy duos, and my laptop. Everything worked like a charm."
5,"When I saw this book, I was not quite sure what to expect.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find it handily beat my expectations.  * The book is a good size.  It's not some 2"" brick and it's not too small.  Just right to throw in your backpack or briefcase. * The format and illustrations are PHENOMENAL!  The book has a very cool, very easy format that just flows.  The color diagrams are a huge bonus. * Book content is well rounded.  It covers all the basics as well as some of the more 'advanced' features.  This makes it very useful for the first time Mac buyer, Windows convert, or casual user.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is jumping into the Mac world or other who just aren't that comfortable yet with the MacBook."
4,"This remote is the perfect solution for controlling my TWC cable box with DVR and my Visio TV, Sony Blu-ray player and Denon AVR. It was easy (15 - 20 minutes) to program the remote to control all this equipment. Still need to use my Visio remote to access Netflix and Amazon Video, but otherwise the TWC remote works great!"
4,"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth.  It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages.  Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.  At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father, I found this book particularly captivating.  My father talked about the elephants, the native Kachin, Chindit, Naga, and Burmese peoples, the Imperial Forces, native built bashas, and the jungle and its wildlife.  At 90, Dad also found the book quite riveting.  This account has outstanding character development, scene description, and intrigue.  Highly recommended for all ages, 10-90!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elephant-Run/dp/0545105668/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elephant Run</a>  Chris Gregory, author, Buckshot Pie, [...] Semper Pi Publishing, semperpi@outlook.com, also as Christopher E.

5,"I would like to say this product works just fine, but I'm not 100% sure. Purchased this to replace the 1st Gen Nook charger for an equally old (surprise) 1st Gen Nook. The Nook itself required a battery replacement as the original had somehow become swollen and useless. So I swapped out the battery and used this to charge the Nook, which seemed to work as the screen went blank after being stuck on the ""low charge"" display. Unfortunately, the Nook didn't seem to hold a charge anymore. Or something else went wrong. In any case, this item worked as described. I think it's just the Nook is dead."
5,"A great product it worked has advertised, and i got it at a great price. I replaced my 32gb with after formatting it, i have all the room i will ever need on my phone."
5,I've bought 4 after making sure my first one arrived and worked.  I love them! Transfer speeds are great and they triple the space on my phone. I have 42 gigs of music on my phone and use it to stream music when in my car. This card works like a charm.
5,It has been working like it should for about a month now. It performs as expected however I would look for the most current model for this product before you complete the purchase.
5,"I recently got myself a Galaxy SV and I knew that the 10gb of phone memory wasn't going to be enough for my music and movie demands. This takes the cake and even though I've crammed more jams and movies than my old silly iPhone could handle, this still leaves gigs free for other stuff. The product arrived promptly and now I'm in love. I don't really care about the supposed ""average speed"", but I love it."
1,"Here's my take on NST:  This is a very nice, but very limited reader.  I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  That's it.  A real home run?  Not quite...  Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.  Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.  (1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).  (2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.  (3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.  When everybody in my family has read that book, I can sell it to the used book store for 15% or 25% of list value.  That's a win-win.  So, where's the advantage with a Nook other than it's cool?  Three strikes (it could get one more if you count fragility compared to a paperback book).  This whole e-reader thing is bravo-sierra at this point.  That's my $0.02.  Just wish I had known this before I spent the hundred dollars."
5,"Apple deserves its reputation for elegant design and intuitive interfaces, but that does not change the fact that computers are initially somewhat difficult to understand - obviously for the first-time user, but perhaps even more so for the desktop PC user making the paradigm shift to Mac, mobility, or both. This book is the perfect curative for this condition.  From a concise overview of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mac-OS-X-10-6-Snow-Leopard/dp/B001AMHWP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard</a>&nbsp;desktop, through initial configuration of network connections and email clients, and then into Apple's bundled applications,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-MacBook/dp/0789743035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My MacBook</a>&nbsp;was cleverly designed to rapidly raise the novice to a level of comfort and proficiency. Each page is laden with full-color images and short step-by-step instructions, teaching the reader exactly what he or she needs to know without unnecessary verbiage or technical detail. While clearly intended to be read start to finish, the book is very well indexed and organized, allowing the user to quickly find the solution to a particular problem if and when the need arises.  Bottom line: if you're not already an Apple genius, and you have a MacBook, check this one out. More computer books should be written like this."
4,"""My MacBook,"" is a good book for reference after your telephone support is gone and you need to read about ""how to's"" and have the computer in front of you. My husband has a very hard time reading from the Apple support page and then coming back to his machine to actually do what it said. With this book he can have the instructions right there.  This book is designed for basic Mac skills. I would have liked to se a few more intermediate skills in it.  This book or something like it should be included for any new users of MacBook users upon purchase."
5,"I wanted to upgrade my Galaxy Tab 3 from 32 to 64 (max cap), this was a good price. Moved the old 32 to my GSII phone (also now at max cap). That's a hell of a lot of songs on the MP3 player!!"
5,"I had given this item a 1 star and bad review because I wasn't giving any instructions of how it worked.  Now that I know how to properly use it I changed it to 5 stars.  The proper way to use it is #1 you need your phone charger to plug it in the small port of the slim port to give it power to display it on your TV.  This does not mean it will charge your phone at the same time too.  On some phone it will charge your device (G4). Now #2 this one is important, you have to put your phone on airplane mode in order not to lose connection from your device to your TV.  If you don't do this video from your phone to the TV will be cutting in and out all the time or won't display it at all.  On some phones it might work without using airplane mode.  But I know that on mine (G4) it won't work unless I put it on airplane mode. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy your product!!.. I was pretty close to throwing mine away in frustration. Glad I did not!"
5,"SanDisk is a Great Brand that lives up to its reputation, with each memory I buy I get more confident that i'll buy my next one form SanDisk... This one gives a steady 18-22 Mbps transfer rate which is very good in its class & form factor & considering that the card reader I used is based on USB 2.0"
4,"I received the initial version of this book which was out of date. This book is updated to the current and has many good factual pieces of information. I would not recommend that he change the cover of the book from Ver 1 to an updated version as it can be confusing. I would recommend purchasing this book but for the author, I would suggest you delve into some of the apps more in depth and subjects as the Labs-what they are and why they can be so helpful."
5,"So far, so good. It works as expected and hasn't had issues with data loss. We haven't tested the speed specifically, but it seems fast enough for what we need."
5,"I have had my Macbook Pro for almost two years now and I must admit there is not a whole lot in this book that I did not already know. For the newbie, however this book is exceptional! I wish this book had been out when I had first gotten my Mac. I feel that Snow Leopard (MAC OS) is intuitive enough, but sometimes just a little bit more information is needed and that is where this book might come in handy. It really covers just about everything in Snow Leopard from system settings and personalizing your Mac, using just about every application including Itunes, and basic troubleshooting.  The book is in full color, with labels on the pictures for the step by step instructions for each item it walks you through. It is very intuitive and easy to understand. I would say that this book would be helpful to both someone who used to use a Windows based system and transitioned to the Mac as well as someone new to computers and bought a new Mac. People already familiar with the Mac won't get too much out of this book though.  I can't recommend this book enough to people who are new to either a Macbook, Macbook Pro or MacBook Air! Buy This Book!  Now, if only the author, John Ray, came out with a more advanced book for me!"
1,"This. Simply. Did. Not. Work.  Companies have to work hard to annoy me, and this product annoyed me on every level.  I plugged it in and all that happened is that my 2nd monitor flashed on and off repeatedly.  I have a similar adapter that works fine, so it's not my computer."
4,"I am very happy that I have never been a fan of the ""Hollywood"" scene or that I never found myself ""needing"" to go Hollywood - because if I base myself on the novels I have been reading about Hollywood, this is NOT a place that I want to be.  In Hollywood is Like High School with Money, we discover that Taylor Henning has, unfortunately, been bitten by the mighty Hollywood bug as she finds herself in the lowest of all the positions (or is that security guard at the gate?).  She is an assistant and she is desperately trying to move on up in that world.  Enter some competition/potential BFF??? - especially Quinn who is loaded with advice, but is she giving it to help Taylor or destroy her?  This novel, which I thought was a fun and devilish read is loaded with true moments of what I would call some true Hollywood horror experiences and stories - as Taylor struggles to stand above it all, she finds herself caught in two worlds - that of her conscious and that of the real Hollywood scene.  What does a sweet, innocent (but quickly becoming less innocent by the minute) girl do to get ahead?  stick by her beliefs or become one of the backstabbers.  I loved that the author explores this issue in an honest and fortright manner - especially through the character of Quinn - which I pretty much hated for much of the book, but also thought was pretty true to the storyline.  This book made me want to scream at Taylor to run far away, but at the same time, I wanted to keep reading to get more ""dish"" on the whole scene.  One of those great beach read/end of summer books that you love to read."
4,"is not 400x600 compatible but just disconnect one of the screw from the extension arm and move it forward one more, and it will fit, but you will just have 2 screw on the bottem arms and not 3, but it's okay i mounted it like that and it stable. I like it a lot."
5,"""Christmas Even Can Kill You"" by William Marantz is an extremely entertaining book! I enjoyed getting to know broken down, Jewish, country singer turned talk-radio jock, Val Virgo. The prose flows well. The dialogue is realistic, sharp, and witty. The characters are well developed and interesting.  This story developed at a quick pace. There were plenty of twists and turns and even a couple hairpin turns that caused my breath to catch in my throat. The mystery kept me guessing. The romance was interesting and believable to me. The conclusion left me feeling satisfied yet interested in learning more about Val Virgo. I particularly enjoyed the flavor added by the Winnipeg setting. I could see the great, white north, and I've never even been there.  This is a good book. Yes, the narrative voice is sarcastic. As one with a deep sarcastic streak myself, I liked it. I wouldn't mind hanging out with these characters. I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it to anyone looking for a quick paced, interesting read."
5,"I have used several different 7 inch tablets. The best I used was the Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus. This is a less expensive tablet and very, very good. But rooting the Nook Tablet made it great.  That is a fairly easy thing to do with a bit of patience and reading. There are step-by-step videos on how to do this and links to necessary files. All you need to get you started is Google ""root Nook Tablet"". Yes, when it is rooted it does void the Nook Tablet warranty, but it can be unrooted without problems.  The screen is beautiful, it is fast and with the micro SD card slot, has plenty of room for storage. I bought my 16gb for $229. A great tablet for the price and I use it every day. Great purchase.  The Galaxy Tabs are noted for audio quality and, of course, have some features that can be useful. But the Nook Tablet is mighty fine and a great investment for the price."
5,"Great, arrived in good time and is everything that I hoped for! Which was that it would come out from the wall far enough and swivel for a 40 in tv in the bedroom."
5,"If you want a wall mount that is universal and can be moved in all directions this is the one to get.  My 42"" Samsung 3D tv mounted easily and the extensions were not required.  I mounted it to a stud and it seems to be very secure.  I am able to swing the tv to watch from my bed or from the lazyboy chair without a problem."
5,"Many moons ago I bought my first Ebook reader, it was a ""Rocket Book""!  I must have read hundreds of books on that little device.  It was just about perfect.  Small and light enough (size of a paperback, weight of a hardback) that I could hold it one hand, easy thumb controls, had a backlight for nighttime reading, I could read the screen in daylight (most of the time) and it stored a bunch of books.  Heck, it even had a stylus for lookup and markup.  The day the battery no longer held a charge a small part of me died with it...  So, the day the iPads came out I quickly adopted them as my go to E-reader. Great devices and they do many things well but they aren't really conducive to being E-readers.  Don't get me wrong, I've read many, many books on my iPads but they've always been just a bit clumsy.  Too big, too heavy, and there's never been a comfortable thumb control for me while holding it. I'm sure the newer and smaller iPad would go a great way to solving some of those problems but all iPads are still basically creatures of the night.  Besides draining my wallet they tend to shrink from the sunshine.  I'll never ditch my iPad but i really, REALLY wanted my old E-reader back.  I didn't want something what would flash the home team's score, an Email telling me my spam filter is less than effective or someone messaging me a picture of their meal all the while I'm trying to immerse myself in one my favorite author's far flung fantasies.  I JUST WANT TO READ A DARN BOOK IN PEACE!  So for a while, GASP, I went back to ""real"" books.  I know, I was weak and no matter how many times I punched that unknown word with my stylus those stupid BOOKS wouldn't bring up a single dictionary.  I've seen E-Ink products for a while.  I remember when the technology was first introduced and how it was going to revolutionize the world. Yeah, whatever.  E-Ink and a perpetual motion machine and we'd be all set.  I think it was Sony that first introduced a viable product.  Good but those screens - egads!  Well, let me say that times have changed.  The current crop of E-ink technology is pretty amazing.  Not perfect but amazing non the less.  I was able to put my hands on the Nook and was very much impressed.  first off, it's light, VERY light.  The E-Ink looks great and the backlight is perfect.  Lots of little features pushed me over the edge such as WiFi for purchases and downloads and a touch screen for a myriad of uses.  As soon as I had my own Nook in hand I down three books on my list.  Wow, it was great!  It goes everywhere with me and when I'm reading, I'M READING.  No distractions.  If I want distractions I'll leave my phone close by.  It really is an amazing device that harkens back to my original Rocket E-book reader - but better.  I love being able to change pages by just touching the side of the screen.  Battery life is amazing assuming I'm not leaving the backlight on all the time and even then it's not too shabby.  I find sometimes I like to turn on the backlight even during the day instead of turning on a lamp.  I gave the Nook 5 stars because it really does everything that it claims to do.  It's a great E-book reader and the cost is pretty cheap imho.  I'm very happy with my purchase and I would absolutely recommend this device to anyone who's interested in mono purpose device.  Gripes, very few and very minor.  The device has four raised marks on its face.  Two on the left and two on the right.  They're buttons for page forward and reverse and can be switch in software as to which set goes forward such and so forth.  I don't use them as I have a hard time pressing them.  I find that if you don't press these lines dead center you aren't pressing the button underneath and there's no tactile feedback that you're on the center of the line.  Perhaps a little dimple or such, similar to the home keys on a keyboard, might help.  Even dead center I find the buttons require a bit more ""push"" than I find easy to do without thinking.  As i said previously, I find it much easier to simply swipe or tap the screen to advance the pages.  Which leads me to touching or swiping the screen.  Sometimes it works a little too well.  When I'm reading a book and have my thumb close to the screen in anticipation of changing the page it will sometimes trigger the page turn without ever actually touching the screen.  Unless it's developed ESP I think it's a just a tad too sensitive.  Also, when I do actually touch the screen, on rare occasions, it will double advance or triple advance the page.  Screen refreshes are much better than 1st gen devices but in bright light there's still a slight ghosting.  They mitigate that by performing a full screen flash every four page turns.  You'll notice the whole screen turn black very quickly before the text returns.  Again, no issues in normal light and I can only see ghosting in very bright direct sunshine.  The only other issue worth mentioning is the Micro SD slot.  I've read that many people have had problems with this slot not holding the memory cards, it tends not to ""lock"" them into place.  I had that same problem and was about to replace the device when it just started working.  Perhaps I wasn't pushing the SD deep enough into the slot as it has to go flush with the opening before it clicks now.  It also gave me some guff in recognizing the card but after a reboot (not just powering off) everything was again hunky dory.  All said and done I find it a delightful little device and I look forward to reading many more books with it.  Hopefully its long term test drive will match its short term success."
5,"Solid. Works as advertised. Comes with all the hardware you'd need... many options for fitting to your setup.  I picked it for the 24"" reach. 32"" Samsung TV. Swing it over the desk, it's a third computer monitor...swing it back to the wall, it's a TV. I couldn't believe the price, but the reviews here gave me the confidence to try it."
3,"If you've never used a computer running Apple's OSX, then this book might be helpful. For most people who've used Apple products--even if just for a few months--this book will be a bit disappointing. It's not a bad book, but it covers some really basic stuff. If you feel confident playing with the dashboard and expose or if you know how to set up Mail, then you probably don't need this book.  Don't get me wrong--the information in this book is really helpful, and even some veterans will learn a trick or two. The thing is that all this information can be found online for free on a variety of Mac help-sites and message boards. So, if you're brand new to Apple and you want to get a head start, you might find this book helpful. But personally I'd just browse the web."
5,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas 2013, I luckily have a job and am in college so I did have a little extra money to give my parents something special this Christmas. I mom kept mentioning the Nook GlowLight and I ended up buying a used version from Unclaimed Baggage (Shout Out!) she loves it very much, my mom is 53 and got used to the touch screen very quickly, she has a 4 page library of Nook Books today."
5,"I have been an Amazon fan for a long time. My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.  My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.  Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.  All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the ""swipe"" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)  Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.  Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.  Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)  Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I ""haunt"" which have AT&T free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a ""need"" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)  So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.  The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)  It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.  I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.  Sincerly R"
5,"I was looking for a very long arm to support my 32"" LED screen.  This product is excellently constructed.  The packaging of the mounting screws was the best I have ever seen.  The instructions were clear and the mounting went flawlessly.  The movement was initially very stiff but by adjusting the various bolts I was able to get the freedom of movement I desired.  I would highly recommend this inexpensive wall mount TV arm."
5,"I was a little leery trusting mounting my 38"" to such a low priced wall mount but my fears were totally unfounded.  The mount went in with quite a bit of work but I also made sure to attach it to the studs.  That thing isn't going anywhere.  Now the full range of motion allowed me to set up the TV in a corner of the room and I can still swing out the TV should I need to add or change out anything behind the set.  I'm thinking this mount will probably outlast the set at this point.  Luckily, there were plenty different VESA options packed into the box that I'm holding on to just in case."
5,"I have been using this device for the last year and a half. I love it. I have had no problems; works like it should. I was surprised to see so many people had received defective devices and wanted to let you know that these are amazing ereaders and you can have a perfectly normal, blah experience like me. It is no better or worse than any other ereader out there. It is my second, so most of my review will be a comparison.  I want my ereader to do ONE THING. I have a tablet for other stuff, iPods, phones, etc. I use an ereader for reading in bed. I have a first gen Nook that still works great, but I hated the user interface. The dual screens were annoying (you always want to touch the upper screen!) and the menus were not intuitive. And that shiny white frame - no! So I was happy to see that in this version all those problems were solved. It features a lovely matte black frame with a rubberized finish and the glowlight is just perfect. Its brightness is fully adjustible and not uneven or distracting.  Notes: - BN gimps the expandable memory of their devices. They suck in this way. 32GB memory card? Nope. That sucker's gonna hold about 230MB. Annoying. Please let me know if they pull their heads out and fix this. - I sideload all my ebooks using Calibre. It is very easy to drag and drop books on and off when you plug it in via USB.  On my 1st gen, I kept about 500 on there at any time (because I could!). That was a bad idea. The library menus were 50 pages long! On this device I only keep about 75 titles. They fit just fine without any extra memory, as they should. - I no longer use BN to purchase books, but when I did it was very easy. I could buy them from the device itself or from another and they would magically appear in my Library. - The library allows you to browse through the book covers. I am a visual person, so this is another advantage over the non-image 1st gen. - EPUB! If you don't know, now you know. In the ereader wars, this is the Nook's leg up. EPUB is the standard, non-proprietary format for ebooks. It is easy enough to convert ebooks to other formats, but why should you have to? ALL ereaders accept EPUB files (except Kindle), so it's just one less thing to worry about. - My best pal has the 1st gen Kindle and also the touchscreen version. She loves them. Aside from having to convert the files to their silly MOBI format, our devices seem very similar. We are just two sides of the same coin. - I have used BN customer service before, and it wasn't that bad. The ereader screen had stray black lines running thru it shortly after purchase. We called and the CS rep had us exchange it in-store for a new one. No big deal."
5,"Easey to put together and install. Used to mount a 37"" LED flat screen. Instuction say to mount the complete unit but if you mount the TV to the back plate on the ground first its a one person job. Well built product for being made in China.wish you could buy American made, better luck next time."
5,"A little less than two years ago I got my mother a keyboard Kindle.  Her eyesight has deteriorated to the point that the black on gray background of the Kindle is not easy for her to read.  And the rocker to move the cursor is not easy for her.  Since reading the Bible is important to her, she needs a set up that allows easy access to chapters in a big, complex book.  So, I was looking into a touch screen.  I went with the Nook Touch with glow light because the light makes the background almost white, and so the text stands out better on a slightly glowing background that doesn't flicker and isn't tiring on the eyes.  The light distribution is very even and not at all distracting as reading with an external light can be.  She can read this much easier in all lighting environments than she could read the Kindle even in a brightly lit environment.  The touch screen responds well, with just a slight touch, and the Nook has manual page turn strips on both sides (as well as touching the screen on one side or the other) so one can hold the Nook and turn the pages easily using only one hand.  The onscreen keyboard responds well, and I didn't have trouble entering the fairly lengthy and complex password to our router network even though the keys in portrait mode are a little small.  Also, this is set up graphically.  Rather than a list of book titles, as on the Kindle, the covers show up (like on the Kindle app), and it's easier to choose the book you want just by a glance and a touch.  There's also a convenient ""back"" key that shows up on the top middle of the screen when pressing a footnote so you can easily return to the text page.  The only thing I miss (but she won't) is the lack of ability to have the text read.  I hear Amazon is in the process of producing a lighted Kindle.  But, my mom needed something sooner rather than later."
5,I ordered this product and it was not what I wanted. I ordered the wrong one. I contacted the company and returned the item with no problems. I ordered and new one from the same company and cannot wait to get it! Thanks!
5,I mounted this t.v. in about 30 minutes.  The instructions were simple.  Came with its own little wrench to loosen and tighten the swivels.  I can say I am very pleased.  Money well spent.
5,"I bought this so I could carry it with me and recharge my Nook when I am out and about. It works very well for that. The prongs of the charger fold down, so they don't tear holes in my bag or anything in the same pocket with it. The charging cable is plenty long enough to reach the outlet at my local coffee shop. It's an official product, so I don't have any worries about it overheating my Nook and causing a fire like knockoff brands can. And if anything happens to my everyday charger, I know I have a spare."
2,"This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.  The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V."
5,"I know, I know. You just get your new gizmo and two months or two weeks later, there is something new to wow you. Do yourself a favor and keep your phone or tablet, spend $50 on this sd card, expand your music and movie library on board and consider it a low cost insurance policy.(As long as your gizmo supports mcsd expansion). Wow ""Them"" with your incredible content!!. Now you can hear the ooohs and aaahhss!! The 64gig mcsd cards works well and works in units that only advertise they accept a 32g card, trust me 90% of the time the class 10 card (FAT 32 format) will work just fine, plug and play. Enjoy. 4 months later and it is still doing the job. Plenty of room for content: apps, songs and video and still happy with my device. No problems or concerns to report. Enjoy. Jb"
4,"I am using this mount for a 27"" LCD in my bedroom. Using a swivel mount with tilt works great for almost any room layout. The black powder-coat paint matches the TV, and looks great. Adjustment and locking is easy with the included hex wrench. I would rate this ""5 stars"" if the mounting screws were better. Made from relatively soft steel, the screw head strips very easily. After ruining one screw, I replaced it with a large black deck screw. It might be advisable to drill small pilot holes before attempting to drive the screws.  Word of caution: If you do not drive the proper mounting screws into the center of a wall stud, if you exceed the specified TV weight limit, or if you try to get by with a really cheap swing arm mount, you may be signing a death sentence for your $500 TV (and perhaps yourself)!"
5,"In my opinion, the Nook Simple Touch is the best e-reader on the market because... well... it's simple. No distractions of email or social media, it lets me immerse myself in a book and I love it!"
1,"I don't know why I bought this tablet, just only one day using it and I stored it in a place where it continues stored... I don't like the screen... it reflects light from many sources (sun, bulbs, etc) despite the type of technology used in the screen...the size is no convenient, I think a bigger one good be better... well, this is my opinion about this product..."
5,"I love my Nook HD+, and already owned two of them.  Unfortunately, Barnes & Noble discontinued this particular model recently, and replaced it with a smaller unit by Samsung, which is less reader"" oriented, and more like a full tablet.  Too bad, because after doing a lot of research, and reading a lot of reviews, the HD+ came out on top as an eReader, for many reasons.  The hardware quality is outstanding, and the screen resolution phenomenal.  Even tiny text is crystal clear.  And the screen is about the size of a page in an average-sized hard-cover book (as opposed to many other readers, whose smaller screens are barely the size of a paperback).  The HD+ offers many tablet-like features, including Apps, Internet access, WiFi, and Bluetooth connectivity.  But it lacks a camera, because it wasn't intended as a tablet, but as a *reader*.  As a tablet, there are some software quirks, but as a reader this unit is truly top-of-the line.  At this writing, there is still some back stock out there, but you'd better move quickly, because when that's gone, there probably won't be any more Nook HD+ models."
5,Very solid Lots of mounting options This unit allowed me to attach to the flat screen and then push the who;e unit back to within 1 inch of th wall Perfect
5,"I absolutely love my Nook HD+.  I bought two for myself because it was such a great deal.  I purchased them through the Barnes & Noble website for $170 and never regretted my choice.  My husband now has one, as does my my sister.  I use it mainly for browsing the web, but also for reading books I have purchased or borrowed on Overdrive.  My two kids (3 & 5) got the 7-inch Nook HD and it comes in handy for our rare restaurant visits, to keep them quiet and occupied.  The micro-sd storage option is wonderful.  It would be great if other tablets offered that, but I guess they want you to use their cloud for backup.  This is simply a great deal for the money."
4,Sturdy and easy to install. It's a little stiff in its movement but it is nicely adjustable and gets the TV out of the way and up against the wall when desired.
5,"Of the many wall mount brackets I researched, this unit met my specific needs. I needed a unit that provided longer than normal extension arm length because some times the TV must face one direction, and other times at 90 to the wall surface. This mount provides perfect length to rotate the television.  Surprisingly, the unit shows up assembled in its box and ready for a quick and easy installation. I did not need the extension arms, and these were not pre-installed for obvious reasons that fewer installations require them. Of the TV wall mounts I have installed in the past (quite a few for myself, friends, family, and neighbors), this one is by far the best and at a fraction of the price of other less-quality units.  The unit is sturdy and easy to adjust, holding up a 50"" 4K television in my home office."
5,"I really enjoyed this book. The plot was believable with enough twists to keep it interesting. I liked the writing style,although was a bit more graphic than I prefer to read. It was well edited. I look forward to reading more in this series."
5,"I could not be happier with the Nook Simple Touch. The e-ink is refreshing, considering I live and work with backlit computer screens - it is nice to turn this ln and read before bed and give my eyes a break. Known issues aside, this is a great product!"
5,"Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+  A new winner in the ""best value in a mid-size Android tablet"" category.  When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)  If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined ""reader"" and ""Android tablet"" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the ""Nook Today"" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just ""back"" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can ""override"" the Nook UI and install other ""launchers"" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]  The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9"" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.  The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.  HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).  The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy ""HOME"" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.  There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice ""soft touch"" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.  The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.  If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)  All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.  I bought mine at the local B&N store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)  The Nook HD+ is a ""sleeper"" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.  A 5 star item for features, design, performance, and value."
5,"I have purchased a total of 4 HDTV wall mounts from the VideoSecu company  and they are all quality products at a very reasonable price. -Tilt TV Mount: for stationary TVs up to 65 inches. -Articulating:  corner mount for SMALL TVs -Long Arm:  corner or high mobility mount for LARGER TVs  All of them are excellent products, and very easy to install."
5,"this is the perfect partner for my new Samsung Galaxy s3 phone!!! works perfectly, it is a must to have, since the Galaxy s3 support SD cards up to 64 GB!!!"
5,"Cannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web!  All other retailers are over-priced for what you are getting - a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a TV that articulates! This mount is reasonably priced.  Pros:  Easy to install (helps to have a cordless driver to drill 6 pilot holes, and to drive in 6 lag screws. You also need to have a stud finder).   - Well fabricated   - Mount does everything advertised (i.e. articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts)  Con's: Really stretching here since this is a good deal: Instructions could use some help for the ""novice"" DIY'ers  Install tip:  It really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the TV mount  Installed a 15.5 lbs, 26 Inch Flat Panel LCD (VESA 200mm X 100mm) to this mount. Mount works beautifully! I originally had the TV sitting a little high on a stand, but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen (inherent problem with cheaper LCD's - not being directly in front of a LCD screen) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to ""tilt down"" the screen.  I would strongly recommend this mount if you are in the market."
3,"...VERY basic. Unless you have never used a computer, this book isn't going to help much. I should rephrase this...if you never used a Macbook, this might help. Good book, just more basic than what I wanted..."
4,"This book contains three novellas about vampires and Christmas.  Frankly, I wouldn't have guessed the two could be combined in any form worth reading but Betts has done it.  This is not a literary masterpiece but it is a fun, very sexy (yes, erotic)read.  If you are looking for something vampire light with a holiday feel then this one is for you.  In response to other reviewers: The cover guy is appropriate, he looks just like what I picture Ian to look like (not so much like Connor or Sean).  Also the names of the men in the Kindle edition that I read have been changed. Nick is Sean and Sergio is Ian."
5,A great album.  Photos fit nicely into its protective sleeves and the camera cover looks cool.  I'm using several to sort out the photos that have been piling up over the last few years.
5,Got my TV mounted with this above my PC and its been on the wall for a year now. No problems with it holds the TV well and its study. Way cheaper than store bought and its perfect for what I got i got a 37 inch HDTV
5,"Simply the best in terms of price and functionality. And if you root it you can access your email, read the online newspapers, post on facebook, etc. An excellent device."
5,"I currently own this and NSTes without the glow light.  The Kindle - gets all of the rave - and maybe it deserves it  - but I am not convinced.  I recently bough a second generation Paperwhite - but do not even like the way it feels in my hand - so - I went looking for the NST with glow light.  What I love about the NST is its simplicity - all functions that I need are delivered with one - maybe two clicks -  I also love that it readily reads ePubs and PDFs and has an expandable memory slot - making it easy root - which I have done only so that I can get the Kindle app.  I have not had any luck with that so far.  So, if you have rooted this recently and have the Kindle app- please advise.  The text is not as crisp as it is on the Papwerwhite - but then again - this is not the most recent model of the NST.  For that model BN went and eliminated the two great features that made the NST stand out from the Kindle - expandable memory slot and the physical buttons.  Now - I am generally a touch screen person.  I never thought I would miss the physical buttons on my e-reader, but then I started using the Paperwhite two weeks ago, I absolutely did not like having to swipe the screen to advance the page.  With the NST - the border on which your fingers grip the device is exactly where you press  to advance the pages - you never have to move a finger onto the screen itself.  However, if you want to, it has touchscreen functionality too.  The NST is also much more comfortable in my small hands - although it is a wider device. This is because part of the back of of it is recessed - giving about an inch of a border all around it for me to grip onto it.  I never feel as if the device will slip out of my hands.  I cannot say the same about the Paperwhite.  Where the Kindle shines - is in offering features such as X-ray and the the lower costs and greater # title offerings on Amazon.  However - the Kindle's features are too often buried - and you do have to search for them - including for the light.  On the NST - you can turn on the light function simply by holding the home button on the front of the device for 2 seconds, a good feature for when you are reaching for your NST in the dark.  You cannot do this on the Kindle -  I know that some people have complained about a blueish hue to the light - but so far - and I have had mine for only two days - I do not see it. The light technology is more advanced on the Kindle - but once again - it is also a more recent device.  And because the light emanates from the top of the device - yes - there is less of an even distribution of it across the page - but it is not anything glaring and does not at all take away from the reading experience. The light on the NST does not detract from that e-ink feel while. The first time I turned on the Kindle's light I felt like I was reading on a tablet and thought - ""THIS is the experience I am trying to get away from.""  Nothing against the Kindle -  I got my first experience with it when I bought my g/f one for her birthday last month and thought that it certainly was worth getting one. I actually first bought the original NST at a great price - but thought that that Kindle would be a better fit for her needs - and this is how I ended up with two NSTes -  and then this one with glow light last week after I was not too impressed with the Paperwhite. Since I was able to get the latest Paperwhite at a $50 discount I - and jumped on it.  I do not know if I have buyer's remorse - it is more that from the start - my very first NST provided me with everything I wanted in an e-reader.  Then the light technology came around and I wanted that - but was not willing to pay the price for this item - just a year after I had purchased the original one without light for $149.  So, I waited.  I do buy most of my books from Amazon simply because they have better prices -but truth be told - once I figure out how to get that Kindle app on my  NSTes - I might just go ahead and sell the Kindle - unless some of these  extra features it has wows me so much that they heighten my reading experiences.  So far, this has not happened.  If you do not need an e-reader with a whole lot of bells - but you want one that had a great light - feels good in the hand - and give you the flexibility of reading all e-texts formats (once rooted correctly) - then this is your device. I was surprised that this cost more than the latest Nook Glowlight - but it could be because it is in higher demand because of both the expandable memory - and physical buttons.  If those things are important to you as well on an e-ink reader- well then - certainly the NST or NST with glowlight  - is your best option.  Happy reading."
5,"The book tells every mac user how to best make use of their macbook.  While I already knew much of the info contained, but self-discovery and self-teaching, there were quite a few things contained within the book that I found most helpful.  The book pretty much contains every and anything one needs to know about how best to use their macbooks and make it work for you whether that be for personal and/or business use.  Especially great for those that do not live or have access to a Apple store and or genuis in person."
5,"I love my chrome, but it is very different from windows this book helps you fill in the gaps, I have used chrome a few times before I bought my notebook, still I find I need to look up how to do certain things. I suggest it if your buying a chrome notebook.  You don't have to, but it saves a lot of stumbling time."
4,"Bought it to hang my 43"" Samsung Plasma. I really like the 24"" reach. Lots of flexibility. very strong. Been using it for over half the year and hasn't shown signs of sag.  Only problem I have was that the mounting plate blocked the power cord from the TV! Therefore I had to plug the cord (with some jigging around and loosening of screws) in first before mounting. One star off for this oddity. Or maybe it's a Samsung thing?"
5,"price: nook - cheaper or same price as kindle with ads. screen: nook (barely) - same screen nook software makes slightly better typeface. non-drm ebook format: nook - supports more popular epub vs kindle support of mobi. other document formats: kindle - supports .doc, .txt, & .rtf; nook doesn't. borrowing from library support: nook - better for now, but popularity of kindles and Amazon marketing may change that, time will tell if libraries start purchasing kindle only ebooks. other paid book sources: nook - can read books purchased from other ebooks stores like google, sony, etc. kindle can't. user interface: nook bells & whistles: kindle - text to speech is incredibly helpful for dyslexics and others. plays mp3s. x-ray is pretty cool. connectivity: kindle - for an additional $50 you can get a kindle with 3G. page turns: nook - slightly faster."
5,"This is the best mount I have ever found, especially for the price. Home Depot has a nearly identical mount for $90. This mount comes with every fastener you could need from Lags, Hollow Wall Anchors, Spacers, to varying lengths of Metric Fasteners to most if not all TVs. They mount easy and are sturdy; I have a 60"" LED TV on one without issue. I also have 32"", 42"", 46"", and 50"" TVs on them; I have used these to mount every LED/LCD TV I or friends have mounted."
4,Why pay the $$$$ at Best Buy when you can get the same products for a fraction of the prices here.  The VideoSecu Long Arm TV Wall Mount Low Profile Full Motion works great.
5,"I've had all the other Nook's and this is the first that I truly love.  The touch screen is accurate and quick, there is no reflection at all, page turns are quicker than the other Nooks.  It's very light, the archiving and rating process is much much easier.  Shopping is easier as well.  I'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook, now I love them equally.  Of all the Nooks, I think this is the best one, I love it.  I only wish it was 3g.  Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers.  When I read on this Nook (just like the other 2), it doesn't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I'm not at my current page.  In this area, the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing.  I'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook.  I'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle."
5,It does the job and it wasn't too hard to install so i'm a happy tv viewer. Nothing bad to say about it. Came with a bunch of bolt options for different make and model TV's
1,"Not the one we ordered exactly but ill still take it because its still the correct gb. Not sure if it'll be better or not but ill be giving it a try.  Update: I have to return the item because it doesn't work for go pro. I get SD Err. I tried multiple times and it's pretty easy inserting a ad card into a go pro so it's definitely the cards fault.  I took it with me on a 4 day trip and wasn't able to get any videos with my go pro of all the hikes I went on. There was no electronic stores near where I traveled, so I wasted my time ordering this card. I recommend you don't waste yours."
5,Perfect replacement for the last one my dog chewed up. It works perfect and even came with some cheap batteries. It arrived quickly and was double packed inside a heavily padded envelope. Will buy again if my dog gets ahold of this one!
5,"I used this for my 47"" Samsung. Its fit/feel is great. Easy installation. Appears strong; although I personally spent way too much on the tv to risk leaving it fully outstretched with too little lag bolts for a long time! It is very convenient to be able to move it away from the wall however and I would feel very comfortable tilt or swiveling if needed. The movement is fluid and easily adjustable.  I am very pleased with my purchase."

It mounts with a VESA 400 x 200 pattern, which is in the product description for this mount, but was not clear from the 3 options given in the documentation. To mount 400 x 200 you need to attach the extensions horizontally. For some reason this possibility isn't mentioned as one of the three options A, B, C which all have the extensions going out diagonally. The mount itself is 200 mm high, so you just need to extend it out to the sides. Another reviewer mistakenly thought it was not possible to mount a 400x200 TV (understandably given the documentation), so I wanted to leave this info here for anybody who needs it.  My basement room is wood paneled with 3/4"" knotty pine, but there was no stud close to the location I needed the TV. So I attached another 3/4"" wood mounting plate to the panelling with 6 construction screws, then attached the mount to that with the included lag bolts. The total thickness is now 1 1/2"" and feels very solid. I even was able to attach a Roku box to the mount with a couple of rubber bands which keeps it out of the way, but the IR remote still works.  As far as cons: the only one is that it's a bit stiff to move around. However, if like me you're just going to set it and leave it, that should be no big deal. All in all highly recommended for a solid, but inexpensive mount."
5,"What can I say; its a MicroSD storage card. However it is a good one. Pretty fast I would say. I would recommend it to others. Provided my tablet with the extra storage for music, videos, picture that I needed so I can't complain. Just a word of advice try and catch it on sale."
5,"I've bought two of these mounts for mounting a 47"" TV. They installed easily and with little hassle. You will need a drill for making the pilot holes, but otherwise it's a very simple install. 2 years later and they still work great."
5,"I had an ATOM D2700 CPU desktop, it used to be my firewall for home.  And adding this memory in there, really boosted some power from the original 1GB to 3GB now.  I guess for a small fee, it really does help with the situation."
4,"Compared to many of the other mounts, this one was a great value! Comes with a bunch of different parts to fit different sized tvs. Range of motion is exactly what I was looking for and I have no qualms about fully extending the arm forward with full weight of the tv. A bit difficult to install by yourself if you have a larger tv and if you have to keep in mind how much area you need if you were to fully extend it left and right (arm length plus tv width)."
5,"I have mounted a 42 inch old LCD. Easy to install. Easy to swivel, there is tilt option but it has to be locked by nuts(it can not be changed without loosing the nuts)."
5,"Only issue so far is the hinges are firm, but that is probably by design (so the tv doesn't swing from where you want it). Overall a fantastic product - that 2' extension really gets it far from the wall and much closer to my desk (using a 40"" 4K tv as a computer monitor)."
4,"I have been using a PC for years and since Christmas I have constantly been asking my husband questions about using my new MacBook Pro, so this book was perfect for me.  It is presented in a very simple, easy to understand format, and doesn't assume one is a computer geek, which is great for me.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I looked up something which was not covered in the book which seemed like a very basic subject, which was frustrating, so I gave the review 4 stars.  If you are starting out with a Mac or are not very computer savvy, I would recommend this book.  It is one I keep close by to my Mac."
4,"The Chromebook I bought was sold without a guide that gets you past very basic interaction with the device.  This book answers most of my 'How do I do that?' questions as I explore the work in progress that the Chromebook is.  While it will soon be obsolete as Google's work progresses, it serves the purpose to help get a lot out of today's (2012) Chromebook."
5,"Does the job we ordered it to do. I followed the instructions for 400x400 and have ""bunny ears,"" as we've been calling them, sticking up past the top of the TV. The holes on the back of our television are not centered though, so I don't think it's the mount, or anything we did wrong. If the four holes were centered on the back it would be fine. We have an LG5600, 42inches. Full motion mount. TV tilts up and down, side to side, along with arm that moves side to side. Great for corner mounting. Easy installation using stud finder, drill, and level. Will be buying another for a different TV. Also have another mount by Videosecu bought 6yrs ago that's held up well. Haven't given it any thought since we put it up in our living room with a 47in Samsung."
1,"All of the slimport adapters I have used with my LG g3 have connection problems, this one is no exception. The seller replaced for free and the replacement is also not working correctly. Like others, the picture and sound cuts out frequently. Steer clear of slimport adaptors, try using DLNA or other ways to stream."
1,"Easy install, but tv went crooked when it was extended towards limit of extension. It was very noticeable when arm was to the right, but not when it was repositioned towards the left. Too much play in the extension joints. Installed this for my dad and next day he said plastic piece had broken off (Turned out to be the cheap plastic wire-run that never quite fit on right anyways). Went out and bought one from Sams club knowing I could return it if it also had extension/tilt problems. Well the one from Sams Club (Omni Basic Series) was just fantastic and it came with two STEEL wire-run holders even though it is a bit shorter on the extension than this wall mount.  My dad had a brand new sharp 32 inch LCD which weighed in around 24 lbs or so. Couldn't even imagine a bigger tv being extended with this. If you're going to keep the tv flat agaibst the wall this should be ok, but I wouldn't cheap out again. Spend another $18 and get an excellent mount from Sams Club, as this one just isn't up to the task."
1,"The unit that was sent to me does not power on. I searched on the Internet and a lot of other people have the same issue. It seems there is a problem with the batteries on these units.... They are supposed to last for a long time, but mine did not even power on once. It would be nice for the end user to be able to take the battery out and replace it; I am going to have to send mine back, even though I had to wait a while to get this one and was looking forward to use it, play with it, test it. Ok, so I sent this one back and got the money back, but not the cost to send it back to seller. I bought a second one from another seller. This one powered on, but had other serious issue with it. I tried to insert a micro SD card, but the casing for the card reader was misaligned and my card fell in the device itself. As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back. Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely. The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely. I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device, but without damaging some places of the plastic cover. I figured that 2GB of internal memory would be enough and I would be loading books on it through the USB connector, by connecting to a computer. But it turns out it does not have 2GB available internally to put books on. It only has 250 MB, like other reviewers have mentioned. I do not know if I can root the device without a card reader to put a card in. Have not tried to root it yet, but I read on the internet that it is possible. That would be the obvious solution to many of its software limitations. I went ahead and bought a third device because I really want a book reader with an E-Ink screen that has a card reader and that one seems fine, but I did not played with it much."
3,"I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the ""bildung?""  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph. I do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way. If you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend."
5,"I bought this card for a 3D camcordar, wich demands FAST access. It delievers. And I'm using also on a canon DLR 20.6mp, which does need fast access too. Nothing to complain at all."
5,The Nook simple touch had made me a fan of reading. I used to be on and off before but never consistent. The fact that it comes with a 2G hard drive and then a micro SD slot makes it easy to start a large library. The weight of it is real light and very easy to use and navigate through. Nothing fancy it just read books and if you got Wifi you can go to the store and look at the endless collection B&N has.
5,Mounting the TV after mounting on wall can be a handful.  It would have been nice to have some type of slide in mount for the TV so you did not have to hold it while putting in 4 screws.  That would make DIY one person installation easier.
5,"This is a wonderful book suitable for many age groups.  It's part fairy tale, part fantasy, part action adventure.  The non-stop action made me thankful for the more sedate portions, which were not overdone. It would make a GREAT movie, with the characters rivaling those of the Harry Potter series.  I found myself becoming quite fond of many of the characters, and was sad for the book to end.  Never fear, though, the end leaves room for a sequel.  The ONLY problem with this book was the editing could have been just a little better.  There were about a dozen words misspelled, and some sentences with a couple of words transposed.  The chapter headings mostly appeared at the bottom of the page, but these were minor minor annoyances.  In short, PLEASE read this book. It has a classic good vs. evil plot and lovable characters sure to delight all ages of readers."
5,"Great little tablet I bought one a yr ago I think (16gb) and I love it!!!! never had any problems with it, infact I got another one today I bought both of mine at Walmart though.......today I got the 32gb and It was on sale for $125!!! That's less then what I paid for my first one (last yr I paid $179 for the 16gb)"
5,I like this book. I appreciate the easy to read charts. The use of color. The chapter divisions & clear explanations. I would not have wanted to open my Google Chromebook without it. If you get a chromebook... this book is a must read/musthave < for ready reference.
5,This mount is just what I needed.  It is strong and sturdy.  It folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns.  A perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television.
5,"With the variety of MicroSD chips on the market, it can be rather mind boggling trying to sort through best one to buy. This one is competitively priced and works great in a GoPro Hero 4 Silver when recording at it's highest resolution/frame rate."
5,"Let just start off by saying that I have tried the Kindle and although an OK hardware device, the interface was terrible.  It felt like the early days of the internet, with textual interfaces, underlined words, fiddling with buttons and keyboard to navigate, and all sorts of annoyances that got in the way of reading and enjoying the device. We returned it within 3 days.  Next we tried the original Nook Black&White, and interface was much better, but the screen had poor contrast. (not the nice Pearl screen as the Kindle has)  Enter Nook Touch.  WOW.  This thing has a top notch interface... they totally put their minds and heart into this one...  it is PERFECT.  Touchscreen makes a world of a difference, and enables the slick interface that allows you to browse the store, personal library, and more.  On-screen Buttons and finger gestures make the magic happen, and this is one device you are sure to LOVE TO USE.  The screen is the new Pearl, so it looks just as good as the Kindle, with the added benefit of touchscreen!  The size?  PERFECT!  Not too big, not too small.  Very thin.  Well built.  Feels durable.  All I can say is this is finally the ereader I've been waiting for...  excellent battery life, good Pearl screen, touchscreen, and perfect size.  To boot, the price is dead on!  $139 with Wifi.  If it gets stolen, I am buying another one immediately!"
5,"This story had me intrigued from the very beginning. Every character is unique and well defined, and the plot is unlike anything else I have read. The story flowed like a Hitchcock movie and had me guessing up until the very end. The protagonist, ""D"" is a far-from-perfect reporter who is well aware of his shortcomings. It was refreshing to read a story where the protagonist is not omnipotent or a superhero. I will be reading more from Moxie Mezcal."
5,"I originally bought this for a Sony 40"" TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42"" instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.  Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.  I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount."
5,"I love this Nook reader.  It is my first upgrade from the original Nook reader,  I love the glowlight. It makes it so much easier to read.  It is easy to use.  Although this is not the current glowlight reader, I feel that it is the better choice.  You have physical back and forward page buttons and a SD card slot which the current model lacks.  Although the new one supposedy has better screen resolution and a better glowlight, it is not noticeable to me.  Altogether, I feel that you get more bang for your buck with this model.  And, the included $5 B & N coupon is a nice little bonus.  The Nook reader was well packaged and quickly shipped.  I highly recommend this Nook and this seller."
5,"Worked perfectly. One side goes into the LG G3 (mine is from T-Mobile) the other will connect to your HDMI Cable (in my case, I connected it to the Asus S1 travel projector) and you even have a plug on the side so you can charge it while it's working. It transfers audio and video in great quality.  Once connected, your monitor/projector/display will basically mimic exactly what you see on the phone. With NO lag. It's like working on a giant phone. I was especially happy to find out that if you use the built in Video playing app on the LG G3, it knows you have connected an external device when playing videos and will let you turn the screen off to save battery while playing a video. The projector is even smart enough to change the orientation based on how the phone is held.  I got my phone connected to a couple of Philips ShoqBox bluetooth speakers and now it's officially MOVIE TIME!"
5,"I wanted to know more about the Chromebook, but couldn't find much information written about it. This book contains everything I wanted to know about what a Chromebook is, and clearly explains what it can and can't do. It points out the similarities and differences between Chrome and other operating systems, discusses using the Cloud, identifies why some things won't work and explains ways to get around the limitations. I found the book informative and very helpful."
5,"Like the various Adustablity, as I had an older model in my living room and it was hard to get it away from the wall when I wanted to angle it.  This one is very light and I can get it to adjust with very little effort, I have some arthritis in my knuckles, so this is a very nice asset.  also I am 5'2"" and I struggled with the older wall mount, this one is in the Identical Location and moves in and out so easily.  You might have to  tighten it up a little more than I have it as it tilts about 2 inches Forward the was I have it, but it is up High and I don't even notice it from my recliner chair."
5,"i bought a funky double hinged wall mount from amazon and it did not work. I went to best buy and they said to purchase this $350 wall mount they had, I snagged a pic of the measurements and extension ability from the box, came home and found this one to be near similar. Needless to say I now have my 47 in LG flat screen securely mounted and sitting pretty in the corner of my living room."
5,"Rye Crenshaw is a man living a fabulous present, working through his miserable past with no idea who he really is.  His success in the country music business has brought him fame, money, and complete loneliness without the blue-blood family that threw him out when he made his own life decision.  When the opportunity to do a right after too many wrongs presents itself Rye grabs it and hires Tory, a small town cook with chef qualities.  Tory is struggling to make any ends meet so the offer to be Ryes personal tour cook is an offer she grabs at with both pancake flipping hands.  Tory cooks for the pleasure of it and has a magic touch when creating her culinary masterpieces which please Rye on every level.  Rye says they are friends and no attraction be advised but following his own rules is proving to be harder than expected when Torys kind heart and wonderful ability to listen melts his heart.  Tory is providing Rye with the acceptance that chasing your dreams is not wrong and having her near brings him a calm he never felt before.  The problems start when they go back to Ryes family to settle old wounds and she sees for herself the chaos of living a perfect life.  Rye went against expectations but trying to help his sisters do the same may prove to create a larger divide than even he can bear.  Tory stands by his side and when she begins to warm his heart and bed it seems no problem is too large that they cannot handle together.  However, when unacceptable leaks to the press about personal things Rye never wanted revealed are exposed the fingers all point to Tory and without trust they have no relationship.  The ensuing battle of wills between them drive  Readers crave, desire, and consume all books that Ava Miles writes, so could you write a little faster Ms. Miles please."
5,"We got this one recently and its a great wall mount. The unit is pretty heavy, so you will need a helper. It also includes a variety of screws to mount also. Our TV documentation stated it was a 400x400 pattern. But after putting hte plate over the back, seems we didn't need the extra extenders as its 200x200. This is on a Samsung 40"" 5000 series LEDTV.  The arm is hard to push and pull, but that is more due to being new and stiff. Make sure you adjust the tilt angle screws as our unit came with them loose so we had to tighten them.  I initially was scared to mount it (what if it falls if I screw up!!!) but its pretty easy. Not only did i use a stud finder to get the general location of the stud, but i also used nails to get the actual edges (those basic studfinders are never ""exact""). make sure you do the same.  not bad for $30-ish"
5,"I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7"" GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7"".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8"" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6"" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7"" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said ""Construction Ahead"" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.  Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy."
5,This is the first book I have read by this author and I absolutely fell in love with her unique style of writing. The storyline captured me from the very first page and I hated to see this story end. I enjoyed all of the secondary characters and I can't wait to read about their stories in the rest of this series.
5,"I've had my nook wifi for several months now and I must say that I absolutely love it. I was an English major in college and I read tons of books so for a long time I went back and forth between the kindle and the nook. I love amazon, but the nook appealed to me more. I finally bought the nook just after I graduated because I had some leftover graduation money and I am so glad I did. The only thing I might have done differently would be to have paid the extra fifty dollars for the free 3g. I don't really use the web browser, but it would be nice to have since I don't get web on my phone. Anyway, the browser is actually not that bad, if you view a regular web page you have to pan side to side to see the whole thing, so for emails I just use the mobile version of yahoo and gmail since I just have to scroll up and down. The browser works well for basics, like email, checking movie times, and a quick wikipedia search.  The nook really isn't any heavier than most books (except maybe mass market paperbacks) and I find it to be very comfortable to hold (though usually I prefer holding it with a cover on so it's more like a book). I love the way the books can be organized in different categories. Usually I just organize them by date last opened though since I read more than one book at a time and can therefore have all the books I'm reading at the top of the list. I also love the touch screen it's not perfect (iPod touch and iPhone touch screens are much better), but I don't mind. The games that are included are absolutely perfect for me too. I love chess and sudoku and hopefully they'll add more in the future to be downloaded, but I'm happy with just those two. The screens contrast is great and while the new Kindle says it has better contrast, I honestly don't think I'd need it to be better. I can read perfectly fine and pictures look great on the screen. Another thing that I love about the nook is that you can personalize the screensaver and background (I know that's not really important, but I like having my favorite pics on my nook).  Anyway, I'm really happy with the nook and I think it was well worth the money. An ereader will never take the place of actual books for me, I still buy both. I usually read free classics and pay for the books that I know I won't really ever want to read again (like the paperbacks I used to buy from target or walmart). Other books that I know I will want to keep to reread, I buy the physical copy. I love the price of ebooks too. Usually they are either equal to or less than the cost of regular books and you can sometimes find them for super cheap! I've never tried the kindle, but honestly I'd say they're probably fairly equal when it comes down to it (I mean really reading a book on a screen doesn't vary that much). If you just go with whichever one sounds better to you, then you'll probably be happy, I know I am!"
5,"You just have to hang on for the ride as the characters strive to find their way through confusing and threatening situations and deal with nasty villains and alien bureaucracy.  Well written, gripping, a brilliant dance of very different cultures. Rural England and gritty crime through the eyes of desperate men in a new and very strange land. This is a Thriller  that  reads like some of the best science fiction, rather like what you might get if Neal Gaiman or William Gibson wrote a contemporary crime thriller.  Tough Chinese Police Inspector Jian speaks no English but has rushed to England to help his Daughter who is in trouble and finds that she is missing and has been lying to him about her life in England. Ding Ming and his wife have  been smuggled into England by human traffickers in hope of finding work and prosperity in the ""Gold Mountain"". Things go really bad really fast, Ding Ming is separated from his wife by the ""Snakeheads"" he tries to deal with unexpected situations and demands from the smugglers in order to be allowed to speak with his wife.  Both these men struggle to find their way in an alien culture without any guidelines. You see events through the eyes and minds of these two men. I don't know  enough about modern Chinese Culture to know if this is as authentic as it seems but I was unable to put the book down until the very satisfying end."
5,"It continues to amaze me how we have progressed.  I still recall our first IBM PC with a gigantic 10 MB full height hard drive!  Now, here is this little micro card capable of 64 GB.  I purchased this MicroSDXC to use with a new Microsoft Surface 2 Tablet, the 32 GB version.  Since the OS and installed software and apps reduced the storage capability to roughly 20-something GB, perhaps a little less, this little card was an ideal choice.  I have several other SanDisk cards and have never had a problem.  This one is used for all Office files, email, photos and videos from my camera.  I would buy it again and will, no doubt, get another as well as recommending this 64GB Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card."
5,"At the time, this was the ereader with the best touch screen, side page-turning buttons, a nice contoured design that made it easy to hold, etc.  I had this ereader for a couple years until I switched to the Kindle Paperwhite.  The Nook Glowlight was my first choice, but the backlight on the screen was super faulty.  I still shop at barnes and noble for all my paperback books rather than amazon, and like bookstores, but I'm no longer on the Nook train."
5,"I was the biggest nook/kindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook. I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (<3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.  The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.  Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.  Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook (or any e-reader in general) enough. You can still buy physical books (I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.  Even though my first nook was free (making it that much sweeter), I would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model, not the color though, that's more like a tablet PC than an e-reader."
5,"I put this in my Samsung Galaxy S5, it's the largest that will work with it, GREAT!  it also works with my ASUS Tablet...  LOVE IT!! Now my ""OLD"" Laptop that was another problem, (NOT THE CARD, The Computer)...  It only accepts 32gb memory cards...  Had to use the son's (he has the newest laptop), to get it up and running with the data transferred PRIOR to installation in the phone..  Buy the card at this price, Best Buy, WalMart, etc couldn't get near the price..."
5,"This card makes carrying data a breeze. I keep movies, games, and music on it, and no matter which ROM I use, it works perfectly. Currently using Cyanogenmod CM10, but even running the stock OS, it worked fine."
5,"The Nook HD+ 9"" is an amazing device for the price, $149.00. The display is comparable to Apple,s iPad, very crisp and bright.  I have used it flawlessly for three weeks.  My uses:  eMailing, web surfing, checking my IRA broker account, reading eBooks and watching movies.  I,ve read two Kindle ebooks, and watched Netflix with supberb results.  The speakers are better than one would expect of a tablet, but I use headphones. Before making the purchase, I compared the ""PLUS"" to the Kindle Fire hd, and the iPad and felt that the PLUS,s display is superior.  Now with Google Play, Chrome, and Kindle app, along with the usual B & N stuff, this a ""no brainer"".  I,ve added my favorite apps, a few photos, about 15 eBooks, and a bunch of bookmarks and still have 86% of the 16gb available.  I doubt I,ll need to add an expansion card, but nice to have that option. The 9"" is perfect for eReading and movie watching. My other tablets are a Nook Color and an Acer A200, but the PLUS beats em hands down.  B & N got this right.  Highly recommend!! Update:  Yesterday, I was able to read out of doors by increasing the brightness to appx 90%.  I could not do this with my Acer.  Suggestion:  When reading indoors, lower the brightness level to 25-30%.  I find this noticeably extends the battery charge.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barnes-Noble-NOOK-HD-Tablet-16GB-Slate-BNTV600-16GB-CPO/dp/B00AGAS6XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+ Tablet 16GB Slate (BNTV600-16GB-CPO)</a>"
1,I do not know if only my one is poor. But my adapter is not working properly. When I connect my Macbook pro with the dell monitor the screen keeps shaking. I borrowed the original VGA adapter from my friend and am using it now and there has no problem. I NEVER recommend this product to anyone.
5,"This fit perfectly in my Motorola Droid Maxx2. I'm able to save data to it without any problems (you will need to set your phone to store data on the SD card  instead of the internal storage on the phone itself). So far, no problems or issues - it just worked OK right from the start. Will post an update if I have any issues with it.  Just remember that what you can store on the card will be determined by the app you're trying to download,  your phone's OS and the phone itself."
5,"the battery is great-about 12-14 hours from 80% charged.  I was wondering how i would like an e-reader vers a book, and i must say that i don't even notice the difference.  love everything about it.  The only thing that could be better is the on/off function and wi-fi.  the power button is very sensistive and is tricky to turn on (at first).  the ewifi range is short.  maybe 30 ft from my router is all i can go.  other than that.  it works great, and at a very fair price"
5,"When looking for some new author's to read, I ran across some consistently high Amazon reviews for author Stephen Leather ( http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Leather/e/B000APS0ZM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1 ).  Not wanting to jump into one of his longer running series, I picked up Nightfall which is the first of a trilogy of books based around Jack Nightingale (yeah, I know, not very subtle).  So with the character name setting a bad start, I grudgingly proceeded to read the book fearing I had stuck myself with some genre sludge written to tap the exploding reader interest in this area.  And in the blink of an eye, fifty pages had passed and I was hooked.  Huh, I didn't see that coming.  Turns out there is a reason the author has received all those 4-5 star reviews, he really knows how to write a solid book, and does a particularly good job of balancing tension and plot advancement, while crafting interesting characters and realistic dialog.  All too often, books of this genre have dialog that is jarringly bad in spots (aka nobody talks like that in real life) or plot devices of the worst sort of Dues Ex Machina kind.  Leather does not fall into either trap.  Its clear the Nightfall series benefits from the author's experiences writing his previous books, as in the wrong hands this could have been a terrible book.  Instead, it ended up a well written, terrifically executed take on the genre.  For fans of the author- if you had not ordered already, feel free to go ahead.  You won't be disappointed.  For others new to Stephen Leather, I think this would be a great jump in point on a talented author.  While I wait for the next two books in the series, I will probably start working my way through his earlier works as well.  This book caused me more than a few late nights, while I read ""one more page"".  Can't praise it more than that."
5,watch out. the devil will try to buy your soul. this was a good horror/mystery book that made me want to read the others. and I will :) I'm loving kindle unlimited books with narration. except now that's pretty much all I get done! that's what I love about Ohio winters. lots of reading time :)
4,"Great bracket for small TVs.  I used it on a 19"" LCD and it worked well.  The large mounting plate may block some connections on some TVs.  Installed easily and could be adjusted to make level.  The links were very tight and need to be loosened for initial installation.  When the TV is in the desired position, you can tighten them up."
4,"For the price it works fine though i have to admit it worries me.  It says it can fit a 55 inch T.V, i put a 48"" TV on it and it by all means fit, but the thin metal bars which bolt to the TV are obviously bowing under the weight.  I'll give it this though, my TV has hung on it for probably over a year now and it hasn't fallen yet, though i can say each day i am waiting for it too.  The full swing motion is nice works as expected, we occasionally turn it toward the kitchen when we are all in there doing things.  I would give it a 5 star but the thin support bars always worry me so that keeps it at a 4."
5,Love this ereader..user friendly in making notes and highlights..you just have to put in a memory card so you will not experience slowing down in making notes..have used mine in making notes for my bible reading such have plenty of notes to write..
5,"This tablet is amazing for running apps at home or using it as an e-reader. I was a little skeptical, considering the price, but it is a solid tablet. I originally bought it with the intent of rooting it, but even on the default Android OS, I am able to run everything i need from the google play store. Obviously gps, led, and camera functions don't work, but of course it was never designed for that. The kindle app works good which makes me wonder why anyone would get a different Android-based e-reader."
5,"Now I have like four different kendels and I am such a Fan.  My darling Daughter n law requested this.  No way, says I.  Then I see these reconditioned ones with a warranty, cases n protective films, new chargers and 16 gb HD.  Had to get it or her.  Only cause she gave me the worlds best gran babies ...and I guess I love her like mad too."
5,"(Edit: 2/21/2010 - After enjoying my new Nook so much I was curious about the complaints I have read on Amazon. I just carefully read all of the negative reviews. There is so much mis-information in those posts you can only come to one conclusion. I would say most of these reviews are staged. Unfortunately fanboys of products love to use their anonymity of the Internet to drag down the competition. Before you beLIEve what you read here, go to a Barnes and Noble store and you can actually hold and use a demo unit. If you are still in doubt of the nook, simply vist the Kindle Boards forums, you can Google it. They have a board ""Other eReaders"" and read the positive raves about the nook from actual Kindle owners.)  I can tell you the Nook I just purchased came with release 1.2 and it absolutely rocks!  One of my Co-workers loaned me his Kindle 2 for a couple of hours so I could get a feel for both devices before I made my decision to purchase. I am not going to bad mouth the Kindle 2 as I am sure it is a fine device. My decision to buy the Nook was based on a few key features I thought important enough to sway me one way over the other.  While in the B&N store, I immediately fell in love with the very intuitive and responsive touch navigation. It just feels natural. I did not even have to look at instructions or guides to figure out how to use the Nook. Great job on the UI design.  After my purchase, I immediately opened the Nook while in store and the device simply connected to the B&N hotspot without user interaction (NICE!). Since I already have a B&N account from the many books I have ordered online, my registration literally took 30 seconds. I just signed in and it was done.  I was so excited, I purchased a book while in the store and sat down and began to read. Since my card info is already stored, buying was a breeze! I just clicked purchase and confirmed, nothing else. My book was available almost immediately.  The Nook feels to be a very solidly built device. The screen size is large and the font is crystal clear. I wish it would have come with a protective case, but while I am here on Amazon...  (Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) Wi-Fi! I am so happy that included Wi-Fi and not just AT&Ts 3G network. We have very spotty cellular coverage in our area. Including Wi-Fi just seems like a no brainer. (Don't worry Kindle fans, I sure it will be included in the K3)  (Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) Expandable Memory. By trade I am a Network Engineer and carry loads of .pdf technical reference guides with me on my Notebook computer. It will be nice to have them at my fingertips.  (Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) LendMe - The LendMe feature allows you to lend books to other Nook owner for up to 2 weeks. Sweet!  (Key feature in decision to purchase the Nook) The Nook has a replaceable battery. Why wouldn't that be included in the design of the Kindle beats me. Having to ship the unit back and pay $59? I don't get it.  Miner points that affected my buying decision  Know the device has the Android OS is a plus. I have found my Android based cell phone is very stable and customizable.  The personalized screensaver is nice.  If you are shopping for an eReader I think either way you go, Nook, Kindle, Sony, etc. eReaders are fun and take reading to the next level. Happy reading!"
5,"My experience with this device has been nothing but wonderful. The battery life is amazing once you tweak with the settings (ie, turning off wifi, adjusting screen brightness and duration or sleep mode...) the touchscreen can be less than hyper responsive at times but it doesn't get in the way of reading at all and wiping it off with my sleeve always gets it working again. I love that it can be updated without much effort and the library management system that barnes and noble uses is quite good.  Honestly this device has all the pros of a kindle with one major upside. The ability to load documents and free ebooks far far far exceeds the kindle. My great aunt wrote a novel before she passed away and had a microsoft word document copy. With the help of some free software, I was able to convert the file and load it onto my nook in a matter of minutes! My sister has a kindle and could not figure out a way to load it onto her device. I have an extensive library of free books and since I can purchase ebooks from anywhere, I have more choices than the kindle.  I've had the device for a year now and I have never had a problem with it freezing, losing my place or being unfairly slow to open. The page turning has never been an issue either."
5,"I bought 64GB microSD card for my Samsung Galaxy Note, since internal memory is only 16GB. So far the memory is working pretty good, descent speed, enough capacity to store all my music and books. I had to format the memory inside my phone in order for the phone to recognize it. Would recommend this MicroSD card to anyone who has a need for high-capacity memory"
5,"I know this borderline heresy on Amazon's website, however, I truly prefer the Nook experience over the Kindle!  My main reason is no ads!  Why be tricked into paying $100 for a Kindle that spams you with advertisements when you can cut out the middleman and get an ad-free Nook?  To be clear, Amazon has 2 identical Kindle Touch versions: with and without advertisements.  You can only get the ad-free version online (for $140) or shell out $40 AFTER you buy the unit.  What?  This is clearly a bait-n-switch because none of this is mentioned if you buy it in a physical store.  The Nook comes with no advertisements and is a wonderful reading experience!  The touch screen is intuitive and responsive, the ebooks look great, and best of all, no hidden ads!"
5,Readability in Sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen; can't be beat! The blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine! I like the Android operation too.
5,"Although I really think that tweens and teens will thoroughly enjoy ""Sleepwalker: The Last Sandman"" I think the book has a great story and meaning to offer to adults as well.  The storytelling is tight and fast paced, but it was the sort of book that you almost didn't want to finish, because you knew you'd miss the characters when the last page was done.  The characters are realistic and even in the most fantastic of situations the author finds them in, you can hear the truth of the characters as you read.  The fantasy elements are so neatly done, that you find yourself believing them just as much as you believe in the more mundane and recognizable reality that Jake, Cole & Sean are experiencing in the story.  Many authors can make fantasy exciting and others can make reality realistic, but to be able to do both is something you don't often seen in YA novels.  Also, unlike many YA books, this story had characters that both boys and girls would be interested in.  This is definitely not a book that will be pegged as a book just for boys or just for girls.  I could easily have seen our family reading this book as a read-aloud book when my daughter was younger.  The chapters are of a manageable size for an evening's read.  But more than that, this book touched on many subjects and emotions that I, as a mother of a teenager who is rapidly preparing to go out on her own, was deeply touched by.  The love of children for their parents, the love of parents for their children, the strength of children, the weaknesses in even the best parent figures - all of these themes come into play in ""Sleepwalker:The Last Sandman"" in a way that made it more than worth my time to read.  I usually archive books as soon as I finish them, but this one I have left on my Kindle. I find myself going back to peek in on the characters and I am anxiously awaiting what happens next!"
5,"Product shipped quickly, and arrived slightly ahead of schedule, even from the other side of out country. The stated storage capacity is rather misleading. It says 2gb, but half of that seems reserved for the system, and most of what's left is reserved for B&N's ebooks. That leaves about 250mb for the rest of your library. Fortunately, a 4gb microSD card cost me a measly $5. Even better, memory card integration is seamless. Amazon's got a great price, too. $10 cheaper than anyone else. Ironic, considering the Nook is their direct competitor. One thing to take into consideration is that the page numbers are synced with the actual pages of the ebook, regardless of font size or line spacing, so you can turn through page 85 two or three times before getting to page 86. It's a little weird, but not a major issue. I got my paws on one of these things in the store, and I'm still surprised at how light and small it is. The last consideration (not really an issue, but an odd choice on their part) is the lack of a file manager on the device. You have to plug the Nook into a computer to delete files. However, it's irrelevant, since all of my ebooks are on the memory card, and I bought a USB adapter for that very reason. All in all, this is a fantastic product, and I am very pleased with it."
5,"I read this romance during a time I was researching various genres of books I could write it. This novel stuck with me because of its message of flawed characters who find love and redemption  at least a few do.  Mary Bridget Washburn must escape her prodigal and criminal past and seek a new life. So she retreats to the small town of Alexandria, Virginia. There she gets a position as a nanny for a widowed pastor with three young children. The oldest of those children is defiant and may be tempted by drugs. Mary perhaps can save her  at the cost of her own anonymity.  A loving relationship grows between Mary and the pastor. But if he knew about her sordid past -- ? And what can Mary do for the pastors oldest daughter to save her from self-destruction?  Struggles like this are real in many homes. This novel can bring insights and also the reassurance of Gods guidance and answers."
5,"Got it to use with my HTC Evo (Android) phone. It works great! To ensure formatting worked I simply put the card into the phone, and then connected the phone via USB to my computer and transferred the files via USB connection. The files and phone worked fine. A little storage space was lost due to the Android formatting or something or other, but with that much space I didn't notice. I have had 10 movies and tv shows on my phone and still not run out of space."
5,"Got this for my Galaxy S4 because the internal storage is apparently only about 9GB out of the advertised 16GB after formatting for Jelly Bean. The card works great so far and its actual storage capacity in the phone is 59.45GB. I've mainly just been able to use it for storing pictures from the camera so far, because I am waiting on Verizon and/or Samsung to release the S4 update in the US so that I can actually transfer some apps to it (especially Play Music which caches all of your songs to the internal storage by default). If you are looking to use this for the same purpose as I am, I would wait until the phone update is released as this could go on sale or lower in price between now and then."
5,"I'm using it on my kitchens wall with a 32 inch TV .So far this mount had been working for me , I was hesitating at the beginning just because of the price but this mount is really good . I would recommended."
5,"5 stars because it was an excellent purchase. It came with all the required parts, the assembly had clear instructions and was easy to install. I am using it for a Sony Bravia 32""... I've had it for 4 months so far and it works great."
5,"This mount was a bargain and quality at the same time!  Easy to install and easy to hang the tv. The only thing I would recommend is to buy separate drywall mounts. I didn't feel comfortable using the ones that came with it, instead I bought 75lb mounts from my local hardware store and used them. Other than that, I love the mount!"
5,"I had a 32GB SDXC I use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 & S4. I've filled it up with pictures and movies. I'm always on the go and don't have the time to sort through what to keep and what to store on my computer. I oreded the 64GB SDXC, it shipped fast and hasn't failed me yet. Works awesome. I recommend it."
5,"Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.  One other thing: the Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.  I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)  Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, ""Wow! it's as good as the Sony!""  Yes, and for about the half the price.  Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.  The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).  The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.  That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.  I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.  The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.  You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.  If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not ""locations"" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.  In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however."
1,Keeps cutting out... phone screen image on TV connects then goes blank after 10 or 15 seconds. Does not work at all when connected to USB power to prevent phone battery discharge. .  Tried to order 2 more from different seller in China.  Never received order and seller (yanzzshop) is slow in responding to inquiry for items never received
4,"I'm not sure how I did it, but miraculously I was able to attach this assembly to the back of my 55"" LG.  Fortunately, this thing was meant to adapt to nearly unlimited orientations and configurations, so after a lot of finagling, I was able to position the arms so that they did not interfere with my power plugs or HDMI cable.  I'm hedging my rating since the product's directions did not mention that it would not work with my TV, and due to the effort required to get it to do so."
5,"I just received this reader after returning a gifted Kindle.  Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.  Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how)."
5,"This is a really nice, impressive, mount more versatile and durable than I expected for the cost. And, it came with all necessary hardware. I lag bolted it through the wall into a stud. It works so well for our 19"" HD TV mounted in front of the treadmill, I bought a second one for a garage tv."
5,"I've had one of these for years now and love it. Got mine for only $39 right around the holidays on sale, so worth it. I have a Nook Color which is great but because of the glare I needed something to take to the beach/pool without any glare issues. This works perfectly just like a real book in the sun, you'll feel as if you are looking at a paper page. I'll get down to the pros/cons. Pros: lightweight, small, simple, holds hundreds of books, only needs a charge 1-2x month, you can create shelves with books of your choosing. Cons: only wifi capable, it is simply a reader for books (not great for magazines or anything in color), no web, checking emails, surfing, games etc.  This will work well for someone who simply wants to read, no frills. For me it's perfect. If you want more, get a tablet. p.s if you like to read at night, get a book light or use the lamp old school style."
5,"Just picked up a refurbished Nook Tablet from newegg's website and its amazing. Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.  Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.  What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.  I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion. Matter of fact I am writing this review on my iPad and shortly I will go back to reading on my Nook Tablet."
5,"In NIGHTFALL, author Stephen Leather takes (presumably temporary) leave of his otherwise ongoing hero, Dan ""Spider"" Shepherd, to give his followers a novel of the occult. Perhaps Leather is contemplating a new direction for the Shepherd series and is stalling for time vis-&agrave;-vis his publisher? Be that as it may, NIGHTFALL is an unexpected treat for those fans seeking a hiatus from the Spider adventures that are perhaps verging uncomfortably close on the too-predictable.  Here, Jack Nightingale is a struggling London private-eye and a former member of the Metropolitan Police's elite CO19 armed response unit, from which he was forced out under a cloud after a suicide-prevention incident went horribly wrong. During his daily routine of catching-out cheating spouses, Jack now learns that he's been willed a palatial country home by a previously unknown man, Ainsley Gosling, claiming to be Nightingale's biological father. Why, the inheritance tax alone will ruin Jack's finances. And then there's the DVD, made shortly before Gosling blew his brains out with a shotgun, on which he apologizes for selling his son's soul to a devil at birth, the delivery due on Nightingale's thirty-third birthday two weeks hence.  As Jack resists belief and the last few days before the closing date trickle away, the bodies begin to pile up as relatives, a close friend, and assorted others meet horrible -- sometimes gruesome - ends. And the teenage girl dressed in Goth black and too much mascara and accompanied by an attentive Border collie. What's she all about?  As a teenager, I enjoyed many novels of the occult. Books by Dennis Wheatley come to mind as representative favorites of my youth, though such pretty much never transit my bookshelf now. However, I recall that the sale of one's soul to the devil is a standard concept of the genre, so nothing in the first three-quarters of NIGHTFALL promised to elevate this thriller above three, perhaps four, stars. That is, until the last couple of chapters, when Nightingale's special talents as a hostage negotiator delivered the book into five-star range with a riveting conclusion.  At one point, Jack ponders whether or not a soul exists. Since the reader of any author of fiction may wonder how much the scribbler imbues the story's main character with his/her own traits, I'm left to speculate if Leather is pondering the existence and state of his own writer's soul as he ages. Does he perhaps think that selling it to his publisher in exchange for undreamed of wealth and power in the literary world too great a price? After all, the devil is in the contractual details.  In any case, Stephen, thank you for another terrific yarn which added considerable entertainment to four days of my life. And you can be assured I'll keep a chary eye on Border collies from now on."
5,"I bought this e-reader right before my vacation to Punta Cana.  I was able to read using this on the beach, even with the bright sunlight glaring down.  The glowlight works awesome and you can even adjust the brightness.  The screen itself is a little bit sluggish, but this is because it's e-ink.  This is normal.  I'm glad I made this purchase and would buy again."
5,"Very good materials, very lightweight,  cheaper than others brands. I have a 47"" LG Led tv and it fit at 100%, and I'm capable of sell my tv, buy an 55"" and use the same mount without problems."
5,I searched around for a TV Wall Mount for my bedroom TV and didn't want to pay the outrageous price I had seen at my local stores. This was a steal compared to what was on the market. Easy instructions and quick installation. I purchased this 6 months ago and it is still holding up and doing fine for my 32 inch Panel TV
5,"We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the ""trucker"" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!"
5,"The nook tablet is great. I have used it to check e-mail,browse and look at books,and also transferred one from my p.c. I like the way it will sync with the direction its rotated,and I love the touch screen. Thanks Amazon!"
5,"Purchased for my sister to hang her TV on a wall and she and her boyfriend reported back to me that mount works great with the 42"" Vizio TV she got for Christmas and was up securely in no time.  I looked around in the retail stores and found that this mount was of similar quality at a much lower price.  What can I say, it does what it is supposed to do, was easy to setup, and is of good value."
5,"This is the original Nook Simple Touch with glo light, buttons on side.  When I heard the new Nook would not have buttons, I ran to the Barnes & Noble last year and they found some of the Barnes & Noble with glo light  in the back.  When I saw it here I bought my third one.  This is the best version in my opinion."
5,"The mount I purchased is great. It is designed for TV's 32"" and under. The link here, and image are not correct. But, I really thought the mount was build well, was easy to install, and the price was fantastic."
5,"This wall mount for my flat screen is just what I was looking for.  If you follow the instructions, it is pretty easy to install.  We installed it into a stud.  If feels very secure and the TV looks great in it's new spot on the wall.  I don't know why you would ever spend more for those overpriced ones, this works great and is a fantastic value!"
5,"Great price!  Super fast shipping!  Had trouble getting this to play nice with my wifi so it kept getting stuck registering with B&N initially.  Until I googled how to bypass that.  I ran it wifi free and leave it off so now now book suggestions or wifi battery drain.  Poppes a $12 Samsung sd card (32gb) in the side and side loaded the crap out of it.  I have 1400 books on here and I still have about 25gb free.  Uses Android chargers, fits in my side ABU pocket, battery lasts for DAYS, glowlight is amazing...we have a newborn.  I can keep the light off in the bedroom and just use the glowlight while I'm rocking her.  I found these here for $35 refurbished....such a steal.  Bought one for me and my baby sister."
5,Another gem hidden amoungst the Amazon halls. This works well for my LED tv's. I used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch. I hung on the sucker and it's not coming down. And I'm 190lbs!
5,"I bought this tablet last month from my Community Colleges bookstore, which is connected with B&N. I was originally gonna get a laptop, but I seen this tablet was just released so I got this instead. I paid 180 for it. It came with some pre-installed apps, some of them can be removed, while others cant. The Google ones can't be uninstalled. Your gonna have about three gbs of memory left, but you'll have even more storage with a memory card (microSDHC). The screen display is is very crisp! I mainly use this tablet to read books, browse the internet, listen to music and watch movies, so I'll just touch on those things.  Chrome browser loads faster than the regular browser. The reader is great. I downloaded PDFs and books from the kindle and nook store. There weren't any issues. The services I used are Spotify and Prime Music apps. Spotify locked up maybe twice so far, which isn't a deal. And Prime music is good, but the artwork is really blurry for some reason. Its not a big deal either. They are both good for listening to music. TuneIn Radio worked well.  For movies I used Netflix. I didn't have any issues with the app. The navigation was easy and videos played smoothly. As far as other apps, theres plenty to choose from. The tablet comes with Google app store and the Samsung app store. Battery life was perfect. I thought it would the battery would die out fast since I use the tablet, but it didn't. There's also a power save option that you could use. It changes the tablet settings to make the battery last even longer. One small issue that bothered me is the notification alert. Its a annoying whistle sound. Minor flaws aside, this is a very good tablet. One more thing, I'll update this review as I test out more of the features.  Update. I forgot to add in my review that kindle books do work on here. I was reading books on the Kindle app. I took some screenshots of the features that I used, but for some weird reason its not letting me add photos to the ""customer image"" section or into my review. I'm not sure if its a glitch on Amazon or something, but I will check into it. Look out for another update."
5,"Very good item; I am happy wit it, and delivery time was excellent!!  I recomended; is a good support for your LED TV. It is easy to install, and it have extra screws for different sizes TV."
5,"I have recently purchased the Nook hd 9"" 32gb tablet. This is an upgrade from the Nook color, which was not an android. This new Nook has to be the greatest gift I ever gave to myself! Ha-Ha. It is a larger tablet, big beautiful screen. Everything works great! It will take me a little time to get used to all of its capabilies. Now I can watch all the tv shows & movies I couldn't on my old tablet. Also it has greater sound-I don't even need earplugs to listen to movies. All of the apps available are astounding. I don't even know what some of them are for, I'm not exactly a tech wiz!  Anybody wanting to upgrade or buy a new tablet, this is the perfect one. They even just lowered the price again to $169.00. I am now in heaven! Thank you Barnes & Noble Nook!"
1,"If less money had been spent on packaging and more on quality, it might be a good product. The product was double-boxed.  The included level was broken. I would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts.  One of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system.  Despite 6 huge lag screws and strong arms, the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates.  Each time I moved it it had to be re-adjusted to be level.  The hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling, it made moving it very difficult.  I used a 26"" tv.  The whole thing went back in the box for a refund."
5,"Pros: eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N. Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).  Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)  I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.  The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.  Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.  The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience. I now prefer it to reading books in print, to be perfectly honest."
3,"The title of this book and the editorial description are both lame.  This is not a book about using (just) your MacBook - but, rather, a Snow Leopard-specific introduction to using any Mac.  The only thing that is really MacBook specific - vs iMac or Mac Pro - is the brief illustration that shows what the various ports are.  This book is only for you if you have an Intel Mac running Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).  Note, too, that every Mac comes with iLife, yet this book does not make mention of any of the iLife applications.  While beautifully laid out and illustrated with screen captures, the editorial content of the book seems to have not been reviewed by a Mac expert, as there are numerous issues throughout that are either awkward, or not appropriate for a typical user.  In the first pages,  the author notes the use of context menus via clicking a right mouse button, but does not note that with certain Apple mice, the right button must be enabled in the System Preferences first.  He then talks about control-clicking (the way to get a secondary click with a single / left mouse button) on the trackpad - and does not mention the more convenient trackpad methods until much later in Chapter 8.  He notes that folders can be dragged to the dock, but does not point out that they can only be dragged to the right side of the dock only.  This is unfortunately typical of the almost-correct instructions throughout the book that a knowledgeable reviewer / editor might have helped smooth out.  On page 23, in a sidebar box called ""Remember your Gestures!"", Ray talks about four-finger swipe, etc., on the trackpad - but he does not introduce these until pages 213-214 in Chapter 8.  Even there, they are not adequately described.  Sort of hard to ""remember"" them on page 23 if you don't see it for another 200 pages.  Chapter 2 contains way too much information on extremely unusual network situations, breaking the flow of the whole book.  Most of the content of this chapter belongs in an Appendix in my opinion.  Much later, on page 150, Ray talks about sharing an internet connection in a way that most users would not understand ... or require.  Chapter 10 describes MobileMe backup before the more fundamental Time Machine backup.  The description of the keychain, which saves passwords, does not mention the importance of a secure login password to protect the (login) keychain.  Describing Address Book, Ray implies that a name can only be a member of one group, not describing dragging into multiple groups and opt-clicking on a name to see which groups it belongs to.  The description of displaying calendars in iCal is incorrect - suggesting that selecting a calendar displays its content, rather than checking the checkbox next to it.  The section on external monitors does not describe the designed-for-MacBook 24"" Apple display or how to operate with the laptop lid closed and with the external monitor as the only active monitor.  The Time Machine pages do not describe at all how to restore files - or how Time Machine can intelligently recognize certain applications, such as Mail, iCal or Address Book and restore individual mail messages, addresses, etc.  So, after not describing fully or correctly many of the basics of using Snow Leopard, Ray then goes into describing how to access the LaunchDaemon lists to delete services, something that most users should stay far away from.  The description of installing a new hard drive (to replace the existing one) is unrealistic unless the drive is dead - suggesting that one reinstall Snow Leopard from the original installation disks.  There is no mention of the more normal choices of (1) boot from the install disk and do a full restore from your Time Machine backup disk, or (2) attach the new disk via a USB or firewire cable and clone the old disk onto the new one before physical installation.  There is nothing in the book on how to burn data onto a CD or DVD via a Finder Burn Folder.  There is no mention of how to create a zip file (via the Compress command in the file context menu).  In summary, a lot of good content that is beautifully displayed, however there are also a lot of errors and omissions and inappropriate material."
5,Awesome price and quality. Simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation. If you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one I'd recommend.
3,"My MacBook is a good step-by-step manual on the default MacBook hardware/software.  Each lesson is well organized, easily explained, and features pictures for those who just want to breeze through and learn a new tip.  While most of this information can be found online or by using the Mac's ""Help"" feature, It was nice just to sit in bed and learn more about my computer without having to be actually on the computer.  This book is definitely not for seasoned Mac users, but is a great guide for those who are thinking of switching to Mac and want to learn more about the interface."
5,"I have been super happy with this reader.  In the bright sun sitting outside, no problem.  On the many flights I take, no problem.  B&N site and downloading books is a breeze.  I've got a Droid X phone, and the accounts sync, so I can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the Nook App, very cool.  I can lend, and have others lend me, some of the books purchased.  Our local library in Central Texas, outside Austin, is connected to Overdrive.com.  With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.  I like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen, personally.  It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen.  Seems like no big deal, but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.  Not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed.  This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.  Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.  You can in a pinch, but it's easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website.  The number of places to get books, especially free ones, is awesome with the Nook handling so many formats.  B&N just search 0.00 and titles and you'll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free.  gutenberg.org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your Nook for free, google books does this and a few other sites.  Tons and Tons of books for free, I haven't read Tom Sawyer in 20+ years and am now, for free.  Just an addition to note.  Lots of periodicals, newspapers etc, that you can get daily.  I take my kids into B&N and they love to look through the kids books.  While there, I can read any book over their Wifi for free for up to an hour.  I don't use this a lot, but once a month or so when I take the kids, it's pretty cool.  Overall, I'm really pysched, this Nook has been awesome."
5,"Smart, sleek and easy-to-read, this Nook is my first E-reader and I am very happy with it. Easy to use all the controls on it and it features an easy to understand manual so you can access all of the reader's many features. Good price, too."
5,"I got this to use in an Android media player, and so far it has worked great! The player's specs claim to support cards only up to 32G, but this one worked fine after I formatted it in the tablet, and it seems fast."
2,"Unfortunately, I'm returning this mount.  Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn't well made.  I purchased it to mount a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LG-26LE5300-26-Inch-720p-60Hz-LED-LCD-HDTV/dp/B0039S7L1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTV</a>&nbsp;in our kitchen.  The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.  Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.  I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.  The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.  The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.  The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.  I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VideoSecu-Swing-LCD-Wall-Mount-20-inch-Extension-55-lb-loading-capacity-for-LCD-TV-Monitor-Flat-Screen-VESA-75mm-100-mm-1US/dp/B000R0FG5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1US</a>&nbsp;gets very high marks from me. It's basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.  I understand that it's a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can't give this mount any higher rating than I have."
5,"I have had this unit about a year and it works great in the bedroom with a 22"" flat screen TV.  Very good function and can't beat the price!  You will need two people to set this up, but it goes easy with four hands and simple directions."
5,"If You are either Dr ""Tony"" Newman or Dr. ""Doug"" Phillips, and the Time Tunnel got stucked in the middle Ages, DON'T BUY IT. A contraire, if You are a present time business person, go get this book. Even if you don't own a Chromebook. You will have a very pleasent ride into the implementation of the Cloud concept, SW and HW wise. Bravo Zulu !! Great Book."
5,"I was hesitant about mounting my larger flat screen (47"" LG) onto the wall - what happens if it falls off!  After looking at mounts at Target and Best Buy that were $100+, would this possibly work?  Fast forward...  The mount took about 20 minutes to install (too longer to locate the studs than mount it).  The TV is on the wall and works wonderfully.  Very solid mount and good articulation.  My only comments are the cord clips included are very weak.  I will be replacing them with black cable ties.  Also - they do need to have a second locking screw where you hang the TV on the articulating mount - I can wiggle my screen (tilt) by about 1/4"" since there is only a screw on the bottom.  Overall, I liked the narrow wall mount and the 20"" extension.  Definitely would recommend for a TV that is 47""."
5,"I bought this mount for a 42 Vizio TV I inherited from my in-law to mount in my home office for computer and TV type use. I had a tight space between a desk and window to mount the TV so I wanted something that could move and this fit the bill. I was a little worried about the one stud mounting design but I made sure to find my stud properly in the wall with a stud finder and use a small nail to poke the wall to find the true edges of the board. Once I did that it was some measure to find where it would sit on the wall as far as TV height. Measure twice and drill once. I drilled the holes for the bracket on the wall starting with the top hole and using a level when marking the bottom hole. I put the lag bolt in the top hole first part way and then again used the level when putting the bottom bolt. Before tightening it down all the way I used the level one last time to get it level to my comfort level. Was done the bracket felt solid on the wall. I then mounted the bracket on the TV with fit perfect on the VESA mounts without using the extension arms that came in the kit. The kit was missing one bolt of the M8-15 bolts but luckily the M8-30 bolts fit into the bottom holes of my TV without being too long so I didn't have to contact Amazon about the missing bolt but was a little disappointed about that. Some quick screw driver work on the mount was on with the washers provided. I adjusted the tilt of the mount to face the TV down for my situation and realized I got it backwards once we lifted the TV but that was just an honest eyeball mistake. Some quick turns with the provided allen wrench to adjust the tilt and back on the wall it went. I tighten the one mounting bolt that holds it on and we are good to go. I adjusted the arm to where I wanted the TV and it felt was very solid. The articulating arms were a little stiff without the TV on their but once I put the 35lb TV on it moved fine, done want a loose swing mount. I didn't experience any sagging or off level issues. It is a two person job for heavy TVs to mount them but I did all the mount work on the wall and TV alone and only needed help with lifting the TV on to the wall when ready. Comes with an assortment of mounting bolts for the different TV holes, wrench, and allen wrench. You will need a drill and some drill bits for pilot holes. Good buy and would buy again."
5,"So, I bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this, or buying the kindle. I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more, and I travel a lot and don't have house wi-fi. I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)  A lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained, and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver, book page etc you were on when it died. There's no 'power-down' it will just stop, and touchscreen will not be active, once you plug it up and charge it a little, it will be good again. Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster (obvious unfortunate fact)  There are a lot of books available at the moment (depending what genre you read) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction (my books), and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books I was interested in. Also B&N really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades (faster page turning, less freezing etc.)Also even when there was a manufacturing error, they were quick to send out a new improved nook. Overall, I love this device, it's fun, its sleek with a solid feel, and it's open-ended for future updates.  It may be for you, it may not. Do your research, read forums and reviews, go into the respective stores and hold and try the device.  Pros:  Removable/replaceable battery  Really crisp 'paper' and 'words'  e-wish list for books  SD card slot  Audio/ music  Free coupons, discounts, and food monthly via nook  e pub library  getting books from Sony ADE  Lending feature  Cons  Battery lasts an average of 7-8 days  touchscreen keyboard a bit small (if you're used to iphone/ipod)  touchscreen may be over sensitive with accidental touch  Small price differences with kindle books (average of a dollar)"
5,"I read a book purely for entertainment. I can live with a few grammatical errors. This book was full of twists and turns and shocks and surprises that I almost didn't go to work when I was supposed to. I was at the point where I really hated to put it down. One thing I really appreciated about this book, unlike many I have started and discarded, is a person really gets to know the character before being introduced to more. This alleviates a lot of confusion. There are some books that have too many unimportant characters that I've had to go back a few pages just to try and figure out who they are talking about and what their importance is. Not this book. All the characters play an important role. Also, there weren't a lot of wasted pages describing unimportant things that really have no bearing on the plot. Too many books will waste pages describing in detail a sex scene or history from a past life that has nothing to do with the story. Yep, this is one of my more enjoyable books that I've read."
5,"Works great... kind of a pain to install it took two guys and some power tools... and a lot of measuring... make sure you follow directions... also I didn't need all the hardware it came with, come one guys... not trying to make my walls swiss cheese. sheesh."
5,"I love the B&N Nook Simple Touch.  I can't compare it to the Amazon Paperwhite, because I refuse to try one.  The Nook has expandable memory (which I do not believe the Paperwhite does).  Up to 32GB, which means I can save around 32,000 books.  If, for some reason, I need more space, then I can just drop another 15-20 bucks, and have another 32GB (though I will have my collection split over two memory cards).  I also like that B&N accepts ePub, which is pretty much the universal standard, whereas Amazon locks you into their own store.  This means that you can shop Sony's store with a Nook, and Nook's store with a Sony, but Amazon can't access either of those stores.  The downside to this is that, as of now, Amazon books tend to be cheaper than any other e-reader store.  However, all the ebooks are usually within a dollar or two, and I like having the freedom to go and purchase e books from multiple stores, instead of just being locked into one.  This is NOT a tablet, and as such, you can't surf the web, download apps, or play games.  What you CAN do is eliminate the tens, if not hundreds, of pounds of books that sit on your bookshelf."
1,"I bought this Nook Simple Touch on Amazon.com, but when I received it, the WiFi would not connect. I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town. Barnes & Noble Customer Service was NO HELP, telling me that, since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from B&N, they could not help me, and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller. I did return it, thinking it was damaged somehow, and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument (kudos to him and Amazon!).  Later, I bought one from B&N, and it had the same problem. Again, B&N Customer Service was NO HELP, but did send a replacement. The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi. Now, I'm arguing with B&N for a full refund.  Most of the reviews are glowing. But what they don't say is that B&N has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch. Even the B&N Forum has many references to the problem.  I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem. Just beware.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
5,"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth. It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages. Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.  At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father, I found this book particularly captivating. My father talked about the elephants, the native Kachin, Chindit, Naga, and Burmese peoples, the Imperial Forces, native built bashas, and the jungle and its wildlife. At 90, Dad also found the book quite riveting.  This account has outstanding character development, scene description, and intrigue. Highly recommended for all ages, 10-90! Elephant Run"
4,"""Hollywood is Like High School with Money"" by Zoey Dean is a charming story about trying to break into the film business and staying there without getting stabbed in the back. Again, another story about Hollywood I had to read; but this time from the viewpoint of an assistant (the lowest of the lowest in that world). This one is funny and quirky and an easy read. Certainly, a good book to escape to the beach with!"
5,Got this for my parents so they could watch tv from the bedroom and free up some space on top of their dresser. I put it up on the wall from the side of their bed. This thing extends out so nicely and doesnt feel cheap one bit. My parents love it and thank me constantly for it! Highly recommend
5,"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it. Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...  Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.  Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.  I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...  Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!  I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.  Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!  What a great gift, and a great buy!!!  **************Update**************** 5/30/2011 The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update.. As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook! I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well. The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!  I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!  You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.  I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.  As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.  ********2012 Update***** Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader. As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.  As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.  Hopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading! Great tool to use to educate children and adults!  Back to my Nook!"
5,"This TV mount works great.  It's easy to use (position-wise)but I can't be sure how easy to install it was, as my son put it up for me (I'm nearly 80) and he didn't seem to have any trouble.  He did seem to have equipment that I wouldn't have had around the house, like a laser beam for getting it centered and level at the same time, a drill, etc. but the bolt holes were matched evenly with the bolt holes on the TV.  I really like it a lot.  Get one and if your under 70, you probably will be able to install it yourself!"
5,It came on time which I love! I thought it would be set up like my other one but it's not and that's cool to! I really like the set up.
5,"This is the original case that would have been sold at the time of the product being offered in the store.  The case package was heavier than the nook itself...well made case, well made box, awesome.  And for the price, you cannot go wrong."
5,I really enjoyed the trilogy. The characters were alive to me and I cared about them. I hated to see it end. Loved all the twists and turns of the story.
4,"Nothing fancy, just decent quality and simple installation.  As may have been mentioned, one must discard the provided Phillips screws that the manufacturer provides to affix the bracket to the wall stud.  Use your own.  The TV I mounted with it is an older flat-panel, so it's a little heavier than the news ones.  This thing isn't fazed, and stays where I put it."
4,"Mary Bridget Washburn is tired of living life as a druggie's woman. Her boyfriend spends all his time out in the back shop making ""candy"" and another man has been eyeing her. Mary knows its just a matter of time before this other man makes his move. But neither man trusts Mary with money. Maybe they know if she has any she'll run away. They just give her enough to buy supplies to make meth and no more.  Finally Mary knows the time as come. She hunts around the rusting trailer until she finds the stash of cash from the drug deals, and then runs away, stealing their pick up truck. She abandons the truck in town, and takes a bus to Alexandria, Virginia, where she takes on her mother's identity and finds sanctuary in the shadow of a decades-old church.  But then a little girl needs Mary's help, and Mary hopes to help them. Can her past stay hidden long enough for her to give the hope she longs to give?  NOT A SPARROW FALLS was originally published back in 2002, and I'm fairly positive that I read it then, but if I did I didn't write a review. The book seems very familiar to me. Mary is a desperate woman, tired of living a life on the wrong side of the law, and yet knowing she is too far gone to return to her roots and the innocence she once knew.  The story is very well told, and not so dark as other stories I've read. There is an undercurrent of hope in this story, even in the darkness of the beginning, so you  know that somehow Mary will be able to dig herself out of the pit she's in. If you missed this story the first time, you won't want to skip it now. Pick up your copy of NOT A SPARROW FALLS for an uplifting story of hope."
5,"I am very happy with my nook tablet.  I wanted a nook ereader that would allow quick and easy access to email and facebook for communication when i don't want to log on to a computer.  I can look up info on the web in an instant.  And i can save paper and get my magazines through my nook.  If you want it to act like an ipad, then just get an ipad.  As for me, i don't need all that, so i prefer to save my money.  Very happy!  (SENT FROM MY NOOK TABLET)  ;-)"
5,"I bought this depending on the reviews I saw, got to say it was worth it, it holds my 40"" TV up perfectly and there has been no issues or problems!!"
5,"Works like a charm! Lies flat on the wall when I want it too and pulls out and swivels like a charm when I need it too!  The instructions call for it to be mounted into a stud in the wall, however mine is mounted directly into the drywall using heavy duty anchors and it works perfect as well! This is a great product for an amazing price!"
5,"I've bought a few Nooks over the years and have always loaded CyanogenMod (plain Android) off an SD card (and a few times on the actual device).  The HD+ is no exception. As long as you understand that it doesn't have a camera, its powerful and inexpensive. It even comes with Google Play! East your hear out Kindle users!  Up for your own project? Head over to the XDA developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of Android either right on the device or run it off a microSD card.  Great screen, fast processor. This thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and Android OS!"
4,"This is a story of God's love, of Providence, redemption, forgiveness, and God's preserving power.  The first eleven chapters move very slowly. They mostly contain background details and I found it very hard to connect with the characters during this time. I had nearly given up on the book when things really turned around. Chapter twelve begins a most wonderful story that will touch your heart. The characters that seem so dry at the beginning come alive later and draw you in. It ends up being a very richly written book.  The book focuses on two people hiding from their past - Alasdair, a Presbyterian minister and prominent radio pastor who was recently widowed and left with three children, and Bridie - a fugitive from both the law and her past. A chance encounter with Alasdair's teenage daughter leads Bridie to accept a position as nanny in Alasdair's house.  This haunting story stayed with me several days after I read it."
5,"This TV mount I bought for just $25 easily outdoes similar ones that cost over $100! It comes preassembled, is easy to mount on the wall, and has clear instructions. It also features a wire holder and cover for the screws on the wall. The joints are a little bit stiff, but with use and maybe a drop of oil this shouldn't be a problem. Definetely a great buy at a agreat price!"
5,"and she was a very happy lady when she opened this for Mothers Day. These are an amazing examples of modern technology ( I have one myself.......to me. I'm 64 years young and things like this still amaze me. Purchase a book over the internet, turn this device on, carry it anywhere within range of a WiFi signal and the book is automatically downloaded into it. Nothing more to do. Just read your new book. Oh....did I mention that I live in Panama?"
5,"I carry this with me everywhere. It lasts FOREVER. The battery literally lasts a month. I use it to read fanfiction primarily and upload all of my stories. Just a warning, unless you root the device it's basically useless. It would not let me put any fanfiction I downloaded on it until I rooted it. Even now, I can see the cover photos but no descriptions because it was designed to only read B&N books. I found ways around this by just clicking on the book and having the summary the main page, but it's still annoying.  Still a must for any reader."
5,"I bought two Nook HD+ because of the low price and high screen resolution about 2 years ago.  I originally operated each Nook with Kit Kat OS off a micro sd card as I didn't want to erase the factory installed OS.  I came to find out Lollipop was available for download.  I paid $15 for the download but I was able to use it on both Nooks.  At $7.5 per upgrade, the money was very well spent.  The factory OS was wait too restrictive and slow.  Lollipop is much better when it comes to manage processor with slow speed and makes the Nook operating much more smooth and faster.  It also opened up to all the apps that are available in Google Play which it was not the case with the factory OS.  I have only played with it for one day but I have no regard in erasing the factory OS and replaced it with the newer OS.  Another advantage is the Nook only comes with 32 gb internal memory.  If you are willing to part way with the B&N OS, you can have up to 64 gb storage between internal and external memories.  I don't know if the external can take more than 32 gb as I am using the micro sd card which was running Kit Kat OS.  I will look into that later.  Suggestion:  If you have a $100 budget and do not mind the tablet does not come with cameras and GPS, an excellent option would be to get a pre-owned Nook and spend $15 for the Lollipop upgrade.  You will get a very decent tablet with 1080p resolution for around $100."
5,Using it in a Sony ActionCam and it works beautifully.  Gives about 5 hours worth of storage at highest resolution.  The battery dies in the camera before this is even close to full.
5,"I have a 42"" Hannspree LCD TV. It weighs 42.5 lbs. Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV. Overall, very happy with this mount."
5,"UPDATE June 2011: My original review is based on have the first two volumes in this collection. This was a combined Birthday & Father's Day gift, allowing me to comment on the full item. This installs with no problem, I chose to uninstall the version I had first. They improved the search engine; I am finding articles that I could not find with the original engine. Quality of each page is very good to excellent. However, two-page items have alignment problems. The two sides are not meeting smoothly. This seems to be a production problem and is NOT in the electronic ZENO copy of the magazines. Other than the above items, my review is still valid. ***************************************************************************************************************************************************************** I have Playboy Cover to Cover for the 50s and the 60s. This item is on my wish list and will be a 2011 gift. While not being able to comment on this item, I can comment on the quality of the oldest magazines and BONDI support. Cover to Cover is just that! Think of an electronic copy complete with inserts, as it existed when published. The quality is never less than a VERY GOOD quality print edition and most are EXCELLENT quality. I have never been unable to read something or found a bad picture. Bondi is the software system that allows you to ""read"" the magazines. Searching is not a major problem. Simple searches produce very good results. Do a search for Grahan Wilson or a playmate and the returned information is excellent. Try looking for a dimly remembered story and returns may not be very good. I have no more problems using the Bondi reader than I have with the reader for the New Yorker or National Geographic and the search results are compatible. I have had the Playboy 50s through two PCs and the change from Windows to VISTA. Bondi supported their reader with a download that installed with no problems. The Playboy 60s had an updated version that installed over the old one without problems. Bondi has more than Playboy under their system. If that is your reason for not buying, you cannot buy any product like this. Playboy is an American icon and a record of the good life for 60 years. The magazines are a trip down memory lane, the fiction is still great, the cartoons are still funny and the women are beautiful."
5,A missle attack in Pittsburg in 2073 causes the surviving students and scientists to fight for survival in a fallout shelter of Helmsby's Research Center.  The suvivors believe there is fallout from the attack and that they are the only survivors so they stay hidden for 3 years until they are too low on supplies to survive. They come out of their shelter to find that are surrounded by vicious shifter animals that will shred them to pieces if caught.  The survivors learn that the military is involved and what they believed happened is not what happened. They are behind a military zone fenced off from the rest of the world with the savages.  Very exciting story.
5,I use it in my hero 3 and it runs very well. I am glad I got it. I have hours of footage that took like 32 gigs so it was a nice addition to my bag. I heard hero 3 burn up the 64 gig. I don't know why but they apparently do even if you don't use it and just put it in. This has not burned up or become unreadable so I will update the review if it does mess up.
5,"New Nook eReader is definitely better than Kindle. * Expandable storage slot * Excellent support for open book formats * Touch screen * Even smaller and compact.  If you are OK with 6 to 8 hours of battery, go for Nook Color and root it. Refurbished ones costs 150-170$. It is an excellent choice in-between eReaders and Android tablets.  Kindle 3G option is attractive for a tablet, but not an eReader."
1,"I consider myself to be a good DIYer. I've installed mounts for my 2 Samsung 46"" and 55"" LED TVs with no problems for 5 years. So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful. I don't know why the manufacturer did not keep both arms the same length. At least they shd have mentioned it in the instructions. This to me is a major product defect. Luckily with Amazon I was able to return this mount but had to pay return S&H."
5,"This is a great product for the price is being sold for, also has a great customer service because my package got lost and was rerouted and they guided me through the entire process"
5,"I have looked at the Nook pretty extensively over the past few months.  I have read review after review on it and am convinced this will be the ereader I purchase.  You might be wondering why I am writing a review for an item that I don't even have yet...  Well, it's because of the price that Amazon is charging for this WIFI only model...  $189?  Why in the world would anyone pay this kind of price through Amazon when they can go to BN.com and purchase it for the real price of $139?  I realize that Barnes and Nobel lowered the price a couple of months ago - but shouldn't that have been enough time to modify the pricing structure here???  I'm at a loss.  Buyer beware here.  Not of the quality of the product, but of it's cost here.  For that extra $50, you could buy 5 ebooks!"
5,"We used to have the basic NOOK without the light.  It worked fine, but at night we needed a flashlight to read it.  This solves that problem.  We like it."
5,Love how light it is! Perfect to tuck into a small bag to carry any where! I keep it tucked into my bag for any opertunity to pull it out and read.
5,The product works great. I have put 2 different Tv's on the wall mount and it works and adjusts great. Plus plenty of hardware for mounting the product was provided.
5,"Bought this to mount a 50"" LG in my daughters' playroom. Installed in about an hour (probably b/c I was doing it by myself) but was still able to do so easily  Very sturdy, with no bowing even when fully extended. Keeps it in place with no problem."
5,"This was a well developed story with characters that gave me clear feelings of sympathy, empathy, impatience and disdain. Mary Beth had a strong if rough beginning, when she finally remembered the grounding of faith she had been raised in, she tried to find her way back. When she finally got away from the environment she was living in, she was drawn back to the church and because of a prayer request from a lonely child she became involved in the life of her family. This was n of what I expected, but definitely worth reading about. I have the rest of the series and will be reading it soon."
5,"I don't know about you but I would hate to have to go through high school again. All the cliques and having to worry about trying to see if you could become popular makes me shudder to even think about it. That's why I could never even think of applying for a job like Taylor. It's sad to say that I probably wouldn't last very long. What I really liked about Taylor is that even though she works in Hollywood, and has the untimely job of being a second assistant, she's not ditzy. She's really quite smart and knows about the actual movie industry even though she's not too knowledgeable about the hierarchy about moving up.  I really liked learning about scripts and background knowledge myself.  It makes the movie industry become more real when you know this stuff and not just like some magical wonderland.  Taylor is also realistic and relatable. This book does not having annoying slang thrown around by characters and there's not really that much name or label dropping.  It's funny seeing her battle wits with Kylie with each trying to outdo and slam down the other. Although Quinn appears to be of help to Taylor, it's also a testament to the lack of parenting that goes on in the industry.  I'm really not a fan of how teens can do all these things, ruin people's lives and then get completely away with it. The only qualm is that this is a storyline that has been done numerous times. Almost every chick flick that takes place in a magazine setting has done this plot. Therefore you know exactly what's going to happen. However the story is so engaging and the plot is witty and funny that it really doesn't matter and you get sucked up into the the lives of the characters.  If you are looking for a great book to bring to the beach this is it. It's a fun read that totally helps you to escape from the normal routines of daily life and brings you to the glamorous world of the rich, famous, and beautiful. I wish this book was part of a series because I would love to learn more about Taylor's life and the world of Hollywood cliques. HIGHLY recommended."
5,"It does the job :) I used it for a whole semester so far, and so far so good. Never had a prob. Very easy to use. Save a few bucks and get this one. Everyone else had these high tech looking ones and they were kind of complaining lol Mine was a good buy. :) yay"
5,"This is a really well made and engineered product which should be twice the price. It has every kind of leveling and tilting adjustment you could want, and a nice finishing piece that goes over the wall plate and lag bolts.  The mounting process can't be rushed and planning everything out before you start makes all the difference. Just make sure you find the middle of a wall stud for the lag bolts.  It easily managed a 47"" led lcd which weighs 35lbs, and it might take the extra 10-12 lbs of a 55"" led lcd if it's not pulled too far from the wall. Since it can swing out over 20"" I'd be carefull about going bigger than the 35lb 47"" tv that I mounted  The only thing which was dissappointing were the two plastic wire holders which are junk (very flimsy, one was broken in the package) and shouldn't be included when simple black wire ties work far better."
5,I had absolutely no problems whatsoever.  I loaded a bunch of movies on here and plan to take it with me for viewing on my table whenever the mood strikes me....I plan on ordering more :)
5,"This book was free. And I am so glad it was because otherwise I would not have read it. Love this series. Sweet romance, good story, a little intrigue some drama but a happy ending."
5,"I bought this for a school assignment for my grandchild who is not that excited about reading. Well, she couldn't put it down. I spoke to the teacher and she said all the kids are really enjoying it. It's a great book for a tween boy or girl."
3,"I purchased an Acer Chromebook and found I needed some assistance. This book covers the basics and is great for a beginner in the Google Chrome OS. It isn't as detailed as I would have liked and had to call on my experience on Ubuntu Linux to fill in the omissions and use some trial and error to get the system to do what I wanted. It is the only manual I found at this time and if you want to get into Chrome OS, it will be a great help but not the perfect instruction manual like Teach Yourself Visually."
3,"Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.  Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.  Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.   Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI's  To sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.  pros: Large screen terrific images outstanding volume  cons: inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and vias a somewhat outdated POI information. Non-truck specific routings. Cost."
5,"I bought this on Amazon for 1/4th of the price in the stores. It has been used to mount both a 40 inch and a 32 inch TV with no issues. It is well built, sturdy and I was never worried that the TVs would come crashing to the ground while on this mount. It is easy enough to do with 1 person (and I'm a girl!). One word of caution...DO NOT use the level that comes with it if you actually want it to be level. Oh, and I would recommend buying different bolts that have sturdier heads. I didn't even attempt to use the bolts that came with this unit because of previous experience (with different products) having the bolt heads snap off halfway in the wall; go to the hardware store and spend $2 to get solid bolts...you won't be sorry when the heads don't snap off."
4,I would describe myself as a very basic Macbook user.  It is primarily used for word processing and surfing the web.  This book provided valuable information and it was intuitive to use and find the topics you need help with.  I keep my copy right by by computer.
5,Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He didn't think he would use an e-reader.  The Nook is so easy to set up and use.  I have one too and we both read with them all the time.
5,"The screen is durable and looks like a real book page.  The covers are terrific and give me the feel of a ""real book"" - not that I needed it after having the nook for a couple of weeks.  The non-glare screen is a HUGE help while I am outside with the kids.  The battery last and lasts, love having the ability to put photos on for my screen saver.  And I haven't even TAPPED into all the other features it has yet.  Love it, love it!"
5,"Fits a Nook HD+ perfectly and gave this tablet a new look! Much prefer this type of plastic clip-on four corners case, rather than the velcroed pocket type of case that this one replaced. Came in the original retail packaging. Only downside: a bit heavier than the PU pleather velcroed case."
5,"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it. Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...  Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.  Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.  I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...  Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!  I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.  Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!  What a great gift, and a great buy!!!"
5,It does exactly what is says.  Can't get any better than that!  Nice to be able to watch movies on the big screen as opposed to my little Nook screen!
5,I love my Nook Book. I bought several nook books and I am please with it. It is easy to buy books with it.. Try it you will not be sorry.
5,"This TV mount is easy to install.  Just follow the directions included.  I installed this near the ceiling and I'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt.  Properly installed, the product is rock solid.  I installed a 32"" tv on it.  I know it can hold much more.  The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that, too."
1,"Bought NEW but I could tell right away that mine had been repackaged and refurbished.  Plus the was missing the 4 arms but had some other random hardware included.  I made mine work for my 32"" set and it serves it's purpose. Just wish the seller was upfront on the condition, I could have bought a used one for $5 less."
1,Complete trash. You will spend more time trying to get it to work than actually enjoying the product. Once you finally get it to work the slightest movement will mess everything up
5,USED THIS TO PUT MY 26 INCH ON AND IT WAS AN EASY DO IT YOURSELF INSTALL AND IT WORKS AS DESCRIBED. BEEN USING IT FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.
4,"I've used Windows for years and wanted this book so I could use my son's Macbook Pro on occasion - when he lets me.  I've been intrigued with Macs since my kids first got on them in their elementary schools.  I've always found them more user friendly and certainly sturdier for kid use than PCs. The only thing that stops me from taking the plunge and buying one is that the software I use for work is only for PCs.  (Since reading this book, I've discovered there are ways around that issue.)  I admit I still have trouble with Mac's interface at times, and the trackpad just about all the time, but this book has helped me through my discomfort. (My two finger slide to scroll is evidently just not effective for some reason.) The layout of this book makes it easy to find what you're looking for without having to read page after page of a part or process' origins in the computer industry. I hate that about most computer books.  My conclusion:  Macs are different. And 'different' doesn't have to mean frustrating. Read the book and take the plunge."
5,"In full disclosure this is the first e-ink reader I have ever owned.  That being said, I've heard complaints from others about older models and have people at work compare their kindles to my nook touch and they think mine is sweet.  For me the size is perfect and once you play around with it, it is very easy to navigate.  It only has wi fi and no 3G but that may not matter to some.  I'm very happy with it so far and my only real complaint is that the B&N accessories are a little on the high side.  I mean really, you're paying 140 bucks for the reader, you shouldn't have to shell out $30 for a case.  Other than that, I think it's really cool and it doesn't have any of the web browser/mp3 nonsense on it that sucks anyway on e readers.  If you're on the fence regarding e readers, go with this one and help keep book stores alive!!!"
5,"This mount is heavy, strong and already in one piece. Almost no directions were needed. The only issue I would have: After the mount is installed I had to lift the TV to the mount and screw the screws in while holding the TV up with one hand. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn't being stupid. The directions confirmed to lift the TV and screw in the screws. Other mounts have a bracket installed on the wall and TV, then I just lift the TV and click it right in. The sturdiness of the mount makes up for this defect in my opinion."
5,"For a good wall mount of a smaller TV, this is perfect. Much cheaper than similar in various stores, and actually is more flush/compact than I have seen on others with all the adjustments you could want.  Only gripe is that the included wrench to tighten the wall bolts is pretty weak and strips itself almost immediately, but it'll work to get it on at least. All hardware needed is included, I had to use a few adapter pieces on my first TV. Getting ready to hook a second one up on another rooms wall, both are 32"" screens. I feel confident they will be there until I decide to remove em.  Wall stud mounting required, but depending on the stud size, you may only get two of the three wall bolts into the stud. Should be enough though."
4,"This is a very nicely laid out, colorful, and beginner-friendly book about the Google Chromebook. 5 stars for that!  The only problem (minus 1 star) is that things have moved on since the book was published. So where the book states that the Chrome OS has no PC-like ""desktop"", it does now. And where the book describes the ""four"" Chromebook models (correct at the time of publishing), there are now some newer models such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Chromebook-Wi-Fi-11-6-Inch/dp/B009LL9VDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Series-3-Chromebox/dp/B007Y8DJEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Series 3 Chromebox</a>. And where the book suggests that the Chrome file manager doesn't allow you to copy files from one location to another... well, now it does. You get the idea.  This book may still be incredibly useful and very appealing to beginners who want a nice pictorial introduction to the Chromebook concepts and device; and if the author published an updated second edition then it would likely be the best book on the subject. In the meantime, you will find more of the recent Chromebook and Chrome developments (like Google Drive) explained in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Chrome-Book-Second-Edition/dp/1481009184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Chrome Book (Second Edition)</a>."
1,"We bought one of these for my mother-in-law hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use. It has been nothing but a pain. Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library. This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software. Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws. What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook. There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.  I would not recommend this unless you plan to purchase only from the Nook itself. Otherwise, it is nothing but frustrating."
5,"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth. It is indeed an outstanding book for young readers; however, this tale is equally interesting for all ages. Just because the main character is a 14 year-old boy, that doesn't diminish the intrigue of this tale.  At 66 and having grown up listening to World War II tales of Burma from my father, I found this book particularly captivating. My father talked about the elephants, the native Kachin, Chindit, Naga, and Burmese peoples, the Imperial Forces, native built bashas, and the jungle and its wildlife. At 90, Dad also found the book quite riveting.  This account has outstanding character development, scene description, and intrigue. Highly recommended for all ages, 10-90! Elephant Run"
3,"I initially bought a Mounting Dream mount, which was very solid and easy to install, but only had a 15"" extension. I needed a 24"" extension for a very tight corner, so I bought this one, but it doesn't seem quite as solid as the Mounting Dream mounts. Still, it gets the job done."
5,Bought this for my son for Christmas.  He had the Nook Color and didn't like the fact that the battery drained so quickly.  He only used it for reading and uses his computer for internet and gaming so this Nook was all he needed.  He loves it and has been able to keep it charged for much longer periods.
5,"Sorry Kindle, but the Nook is my book. I studied the various ereaders and tablets trying to decide what to spend my money on. Loved the idea of an iPad, but $600 is ridiculous for books, and it's size prohibits simple everyday usage. Android tablets seem too fickle and the technology is changing daily, without being upgradeable.  So that leaves dedicated ereaders. Kindle was out for two main reasons: proprietary file format prohibits library rentals, and removable battery. The nook just seemed the right set of features."
5,"This was a present for myself, my son installed it, in about 25 minutes, and I couldn't be happier.  I wasn't sure this was for me as it for my bedroom, but my husband and I love it.  So easy to move the TV no matter where you are in the room.  A great buy."
5,"Good quality.  Must mount on a stud.  I mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall, adding a 2 ft 2x4 in the metal stud track, patched the hole and then put up the mount.  Holds a 37"" TV without a problem,even added a DVD player to the bottom of the TV and it is still on the wall after about 8 months.  Price on this item was great and it was sent with FREE FREIGHT!"
5,I was looking for the larger capacity SD to supplement my SSD main drive and this 64G microSD fit my needs very well.  Absolutely no issues - works exactly as advertised and meets my needs perfectly!
1,"I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.  My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.  Wayne"
1,"Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it won't work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. I'm calling the B&N tech people. If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems. I have better things to do.  Update: Customer service didn't help. Took it to Barnes & Nooble Store but the battery had drained in less then a week so they couldn't look at it. I figured if the battery can't hold a charge for that long than I didn't want the device. The seller agreed to take it back for a restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping. This thing cost me time and money, a bad experience all  around. I'll never buy a B & N product again, certainly not from a third party seller.  I've ordered a Sony reader directly from Sony. Hopefully I'll have better luck"
5,"I have more room than I know what to do with. I bought this for my G-Note 10.1 and it is great! It even works on my original G-Note phone. The only thing I don't like is that at first it couldn't be read due to it's format. you first have to reformat it to another file type. I can't remember if it came formatted in exfat or fat 32. anyway, it works now. I would recommend this product to anyone!!!"
5,"Most of my family uses mac computers. My mom used to work in a UNIX/PC environment. She loves her mac, but often wishes she had a manual. Well now she does. This book is colorful and has a nice layout. My one small complaint with format is that I wished it was slightly bigger so that the font might be larger. Personally, I go to mac help or forums when I have difficulty, but if you, like my mom, prefer a book in hand, this just might be the perfect product for you."
5,"The 90 degree connector is a bonus that allows her to read while it is charging without the older style straight connector sticking down.  This cable does everything including charging, and data transfer, works just as well as the original that came with her Nook Color, but better."
5,2GB really peps up a Win7 netbook.  How stupid Micro$oft won't let them put Win7 on a 2GB netbook....?? This memory stick is very well made and should give your netbook/notebook a lifetime of service.
5,"This is for me one of the coolest books I have read in a while.  I don't know what it is but whatever it is the author needs to bottle it.  We are reading a story about Jack Nightingale.  This is a guy that had a loving set of parents that were killed when he was younger, he was a cop once and quit the force after an ""accident."" and becomes an investigator.  He smokes to much, he drinks to much and lives a pretty plain life until he finds out his parents weren't his parents.  He was adopted right when he was born, his real father was a satanist, his mother was a nutter and as he finds this out he finds out he has 2 weeks until he is dragged to hell as his father sold his soul to a devil before he was born.  Not the Devil, one of his minions.  We learn about Jack, his friends and everything about him as he races around trying to figure out his birthright before he dies.  This is a really good book and if you like a good story, this is exactly the book for you."
5,"Didn't think it would work as well as it has, because the metal was a lighter guage than we expected, but it hardly deflected from the weight of the TV, even extended straight out."
5,"I used this to hang my 40"" LCD that I bought back in 07, so it's a heavy TV that outweighs my new 50"".  Everything seems to be made well, it was easy to install myself, and the TV has been hanging for 2 months now from a brick wall at it's full reach.  I can't imagine paying $100 for other TV wall mounts, as well as this one performs."
5,"Fast, Simple to use and overall a very inexpensive laptop.  If your using your laptop to just surf the web and check your email then this little guy is perfect. And don't forget all the free apps that Google has in the store. Also you get a lot of free cloud storage from Google as well.  So simple my mother can use it!"
5,"I bought this as an upgrade for the 32gb micro SD card I'd been using in my Samsung Galaxy S3.  I read many other reviews before purchasing, so had no trouble getting the card to work properly. I popped it in without copying any data to it, the used the phone's settings manager to format it. Then I copied all the data from the previous card. Works perfectly, double the space."
5,"I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose. It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked. I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better. The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day. The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook. Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them. Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damage I'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months"
5,"This product is great, gives me all sorts of room for apps and music and stuff on my cell phone.  The seller is very responsive and I recommend SanDisk products."
5,"Great card.  However, Samsung galaxy users beware that the new operating system will not let you download most apps to an external card.  It is not the fault of this card, but a Samsung operating system deficiency."
5,"I'm happy, satisfied and proud of myself by selecting such a wonderful tablet like my NOOK.  Honestly it worths more than a five star rating. I will recall a phrase in a movie, it came to a certain point when I had to decide between style and substance... That's right! I got both on this Tablet.  The product arrived two weeks ago, I did charge the battery and afterwards registreded the product so I immediately starting getting books, nowadays I have plenty of Nook Books to read ahead.  My co-workers and friends love the aesthetics of the Nook look, as I love all the features in the device.  Pros: All of them.- The screen is so clear (""Wows!"" me all the time), fast response to tasks, easy menu, fast processor, Micro SD card slot added 32GB extra fun (big smile), lightweight, long life battery. etc.  Cons: None"
5,"I have had this virtually indestructible tank for around 3 years. I have had to replace the charging cord only once (used generic.) Also, the charging cord for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 works with my old Nook Tab (16gb.) My almost 4 year old and 20th month old use my Nook Tab now. I initially purchased it after seeing that the tab can survive being dropped and this has proven to be true:  My 20th month has hurled it down our stairs more than once It has been dropped dozens of times stepped on been generally abused, had food smeared on it etc.  The thing refuses to die! It doesn't have a case on it! The screen has a minor scratch or two, the bezel is a bit scratched/dinged but the tablet still works/speaker still works etc. I love the parental controls, too.  I have been blown away by the durability of this $250ish tablet (what it cost when I bought it brand new 3 yrs ago.) Thanks, B&N!"
5,"Quality and build are excellent.  I bought it to try it on my LG Stylo but this phone will not recognize the device, it's the phone's fault, not the Slimport.  The Stylo just does not have video out through the USB."
5,"Quality was excellent. Instructions were clear. It was not clear about a tilt feature, but there was enough to level it when I finished. Be careful to get the wall bracket real vertical. (I was using it for a 23 inch computer screen so I really need it to be level for reading.) Everything I needed plus lots of extra hardware for different situations."
5,"Been using this card for just over a year of daily use and it has no issues. It is acceptably fast (I never think about the read/write speeds when using it), reliable, affordable, and holds plenty of media. A good purchase."
5,I bought this card to add to my HTC EVO V and once formatted in phone I now have a smart phone with over 60gb of storage. The transfer rate between the sd card and phone is acceptable and it is great to have so much storage on a smart phone.
5,"I am very happy with this affordable wall mount for my Sony 32"" Internet TV. One nice feature ist that you can swivel the mounted TV depending on where you are seated."
5,I formatted mine NTFS and then installed it in my tablet. Booted tablet and it saw it right away. It gives me a lot of storage at a very low price. I have put some movies on it and they played just fine.
5,Quick and easy installation - very solid product. Very pleased with this purchase. When in need of this type mount again I will certainly purchase this brand/model again. Great price on Amazon makes it very easy.
5,I bought this to display some vintage photos that my father had taken while overseas during the Korean War. I dissplay it side by side with the camera he used. Love it. Great quality for the very reasonable price! Exactly what I expected.
5,"When we first bought our bedroom tv, we looked at the mounts in the store and almost fell over from shock at the prices.  This is one of the best prices I have found on mounts.  This mount went up easy and moves in all directions to get the perfect viewing angle.  it comes with everything you need but the drill and tv!  You won't be disappointed with this brand."
5,"Fresh from Connecticut, Taylor Henning lands a dream job at a major movie studio. Okay, so she's not a Creative Executive whose job it is to read and recommend screenplays for the studios to produce. No... she's just an assistant to the assistant of the powerful Iris Whitaker, President of Production.  When first assistant Kylie Arthur sabotages Taylor at the first opportunity she almost gets fired. That's when Taylor realizes that Hollywood is just like high school. If you're not in, no one wants to be your friend.  In order for Taylor to survive in this environment she enlists the help of Iris' sixteen year old daughter Quinn. Irritated to no end Quinn nevertheless takes on the challenge and begins texting Taylor ""rules"" to get ahead in the cut throat world of the movie business and amazingly enough her tips are working! That is until Quinn's next rule is to steal Kylie's boyfriend. Torn between doing the right thing and securing her real dream job Taylor has some tough decisions to make.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book!! It was so much fun. Yes it did remind me a lot of The Devil Wears Prada but Taylor became a cherished character and I very much wanted her to succeed. I even loved the snarky Quinn. She was a spoiled brat but she had a good heart and I was rooting for her too. This is a fun breezy read that I recommend to all chick lit lovers."
5,"After purchasing cheap cords from another website, I was a little scared to purchase. So glad I did though!  It works great and the design will keep the cord from breaking so easily. Price is still kind of high for a power cord but it is worth it."
5,"I'm one of those readers that loves buying physical books and who has avoided e-readers and e-books for as long as I could. I got my nook as a hand-me-down from my girlfriend's father who bought it and almost immediately realized he had no use for it. It's been sitting around the house for about two years now, getting extremely occasional use. Recently I've found myself in a situation where I have to purchase e-books regularly because many of my favorite authors are releasing novellas or short story collections without print versions, and this has come in extremely handy.  Now that I've been using it more, I have to say I'm incredibly impressed by how well this technology that was designed in 2011 holds up today. I have zero complaints about it, hardware or software. I doubt I'll feel even the slightest urge to purchase a newer e-reader until this one bites the dust. The text is clear and crisp. The device itself is lightweight, feels good in the hand, and is pretty much the exact size and shape I would want--not too big, not too small.  The software works perfectly for how I use it. The touchscreen works better than you'd expect. I've had no issues typing on it in the rare cases where I do need to type, and everything is simple to navigate. One minor touch I love is that when the device sleeps or when you lock it the screen shows a classy black and white drawing of a famous author. I'm sure the Kindle has something similar.  One thing people might be frustrated by is that you can't just buy a book off Amazon and have it automatically sync over wifi or whispernet like you can with a Kindle. For me, that's not a problem. I rarely buy e-books. Usually, like I said, it's a new novella from a favored author which doesn't happen that frequently. Otherwise it's typically books I got from a humble e-book bundle. Since Amazon wouldn't automatically sync those to a kindle even if I had one, I've settled into using calibri to manage my e-book library and transfer over usb to my nook with the proper metadata and in the proper format (calibri can convert anything to anything and keeps the original intact). For those wondering, you CAN buy the kindle version of an e-book on amazon and get it on your nook using calibri fairly easily. There are guides out there that spell it all out, so just google it."
5,"I choose this product because it's capable of support diferent formats, I convert my pdf files in EPUB whit free programs (calibre and sigil) and mi readings are now easy and the graphics are visualized correctly."
5,This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:  - You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate. - The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place. - On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid. - It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.  Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.  Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.
5,"I purchased this micro SD card to use in a contour+ camera that I have mounted in my vehicle (I often make interstate drives) and wanted to extend the record time greater than the 32gb cards that I have.  I have not made a long trip with this card at this point, but it tested to be 64GB and has quick speed for video.  I generally get about 8 hours of recording on a 32GB card so on a drive longer than that, I have to change cards.  I expect this card to far exceed record time to cover any driving time I will make in a single day.  It immediately formatted to use in the Contour camera and works great.  I recommend this card if you want a higher speed/higher capacity card."
3,"One of the bolts seems to come loose with side-to-side rotation. I'm keeping an eye on it now, but it was pretty significantly unscrewed when I first noticed, which was scary. It might be worth the money to buy one that is certified."
5,"Awesome card, no issues. Works well with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Samsung-Captivate-Glide-Android-Phone-AT-T/dp/B0068PZ4IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Samsung Captivate Glide Android Phone (AT&T)</a>. Formatted the card using the phone, loaded up the card with FLAC uncompressed music, all smooth. Check out the photos if you still have doubts."
5,"I really like my SanDisk Ultra 64GB UHS-I Micro SDXC card I got locally at BJ's. I'm using it in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ausdom-A261/dp/B00VEA22V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ausdom A261</a>&nbsp;HD dash cam. If you are looking for a dash cam I think it is a pretty good value. I picked SanDisk for the memory because of their reputation for quality and reliability.  I inserted my 64GB card and let the Ausdom dash cam format it as recommended. It has operated flawlessly recording HD video for weeks now. It has no problems so far with summer heat in my parked car. No sign of any problems in the harsh summer environment of a closed automobile.  Since I can access the Micro SDXC card via the Ausdom USB I have not needed to use the SD adapter. While I expect it works just fine I can't say for sure. Not a whole lot more to say except that this micro SDXC card packs a lot of storage in a small space with access speeds that work great for demanding driving HD.  The SanDisk Ultra Micro SDXC card with adapter meets my dash cam needs handily. Experience with the SanDisk brand gives me confidence it will keep working. That's a 5 star performer for me.  Hope this helps someone!"
5,"I've had my Nook for about 2 weeks and love it. Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.  With the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.  The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.  So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read. Lastly, I'm glad I bought a case for it because I pretty much take it every place I go so the hard case prevents the screen from getting scratched or broken.  I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,Holds the TV fine and the articulation is great.  We use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill.  Has cable mgmt as well.
5,"I discovered Linda Nichols a few years ago when I read At the Scent of Water. It was at a time that I was desperately seeking books from Christian authors I'd never read before. The book impressed me, but I hadn't read anything else by Nichols, but this book made up for lost time. Nichols is a great storyteller.  I'm a bit critical about the ""Christian"" message in books, mainly because it's often heavy-handed. Most of the ""conversions"" are contrived and the characters have to twist into some awkward positions in order to see Jesus. In this book, however, the theme of redemption is woven in each scene. Each character discovers God's redemptive power in their own way. Also, Nichols has a way with finding a scripture and creating a moving story around it. She beautifully illustrates the promise of Matthew 10:29.  The pacing was great, also. I only found myself skimming twice, mainly at the end of chapters because I was eager to know what happened next. Some parts of the plot seemed predictable when I began the book, like Samantha's life as troubled teen and Jonah's situation. Nichols, however, takes these time-honored roles and made them interesting enough to keep me turning the pages.  Most of all, I think I enjoyed the book because it touches on the topic of ministerial burn-out. It is something that happens in church often but no one really seems to offer any solutions. The book, even thought it's a fictional account, shows a pretty realistic picture of how ministers get trapped in doing the Lord's work but not hearing from Him. I found myself going from rooting for Alistair to turn things around to being angry that he couldn't see how far he'd gone from what God intending.  More than once while reading this book, I had to force myself to stop reading in go to bed. Only a great book will make me do that."
5,I bought this book before making the decision to buy a Chromebook. It was worth the price and the time invested in reading. The Samsung Series 5 550 Chromebook I then bought proved to be and excellent computer.
5,"Real love anyone? Heartache and sass, good food and good songs, a family pulling back together after drifting apart, this is a heartfelt story that would make anyone believe in love. Ms. Miles plays with words like a virtuoso, buy a box of tissues for the most endearing parts..."
5,"Sweet little device enables you to use USB flash drives and hard drives with your Galaxy devices.  Be advised it does not send very much power over the connection, so some external hard drives may not function."
5,"The TV is still hanging from the wall so that's a good thing. The info for this wall mount says it is good for up to 66 LBS. Our old Phillips 37"" flat screen weighs 58 LBS (including the stand) and after 3 weeks the TV and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical 2 x4"" frame member. The mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts, bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand TVs. I had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old Phillips."
5,"Title: My MacBook Aurthor: John Ray Publisher: Que Publishing Copyright: 2010 ISBN-13: 978-0-7897-4303-9  Although the title of this book is My MacBook, this book covers all of Apple's laptops - MacBook, the MacBook Pros and the MacBook Air in depth. John Ray provides a solid, uncomplicated tour of these machines and has arranged the information so that it's easy to understand. Of course, a how-to book is not necessarily designed to read from cover to cover and this one is well indexed and organized so that answers to questions can be found easily. In addition to set-up and basic instructions, the book takes on some daunting subjects such as networking, sharing and wireless connectivity in a calm, non-intimidating way. In addition, a complete explanation of MobileMe and Airport Extreme are both very helpful. All experience levels will get a lot of good information from the 325 page book. Highly recommended."
5,Ended up using this as a birthday gift for one of my granddaughters. Just the right size for putting in some old photos--her mother when her mother was growing up. Pics of the granddaughter when she was a baby. Added a few such photos and then invited her to come over and look through old photos to see if she wants any others.
4,"Synopsis:  Taylor Henning started her dream job at a major Hollywood studio. For as long as she can remember, Taylor has loved movies. The reclusive director Michael Deming and his seminal work Journal Girl have been a particular inspiration for Taylor. Although she's never received a response, Taylor sends Deming updates on her Hollywood experience.  Taylor soon finds that life as a second assistant involves small tasks and not the selection and producing of ""great films,"" at least to start. But more than the type of work, it's her co-workers that make Taylor miserable. It's like high school all over with the popular girls and their mean tricks. Taylor's too much of a nice girl to acclimatize. Outwitted one too many times by first assistant Kylie and with her job at risk, Taylor asks Quinn, her boss's popular teenage daughter, for tactical advice. It's not about being mean. It's about being confident. Not taking anyone's @#$%...Fake it till you make it...Speak up in class. When you're quiet, you're invisible...Make 1 cool friend...Lunch is a battleground...Enlist a faithful assistant. Taking Quinn's advice, Taylor wins victories against Kylie.  As Taylor starts to come into her own, a creative executive position opens up. Competing against Kylie and the other assistants for the promotion, Taylor proves willing to use darker methods to advance.  Review:  Hollywood is Like High School With Money is the first Zoey Dean novel that I've read. Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully. It may be that I'm inured to violence and too sensitive to female bullying, but when I got to where Kylie was setting the first trap for Taylor, I found the tension unbearable. I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn't put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.  Overall, Hollywood is Like High School With Money is a light, satisfying read. I highly recommend it as a fun escape.  Publisher: Grand Central Publishing (July 23, 2009), 288 pages.  Courtesy of Hatchette Books Group."
5,Great tv mount! I purchased this to mount my tv outside. It is plenty sturdy and the swivel is really helpful for moving it to the perfect location or getting it out of the way when not using the tv.
5,"After taking a Nexus 7 and an Ipad to the beach and failing to be able to read a book (dammit),  I bought the nook.  Using it in bright sunlight, and be able to read in the dark is Awesome!"
4,"If you are a Mac OSX MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook AIR newbie or have used these laptops for some time without really ""digging into"" the system then this is a good book for you. The author does a good job of very clearly outlining the essential operating elements of your Mac laptop in an easy to understand style that may bore the more advanced users but is spot on for us beginning and intermediate users who will find the book to be a useful reference. He does a very nice job of walking us through the screens necessary to connect to wireless networks and even has a section on how to use your iPhone to tether WiFi to your laptop. He does a good job of taking us through the basic programs included with OSX including Mail, Safari, Address Book, iCal and the rest of the lot including the ins and out of iTunes and MobileMe. The book goes into linking the Mac laptop with external devices as well as providing some solid advice on how to keep your data ""safer"" through activating the firewall and how to use Time Machine. The troubleshooting section is OK but he doesn't go into much detail on how to utilize some of the software tools available for diagnosis but does provide a listing of helpful tools and where to obtain them. In summary, this book is really ""The Missing Manual"" (as many Que Publishing books were called previously) and should be an essential purchase with any new Mac laptop in order to obtain the most out of your system."
5,I have the original Nook and I had to use a night light when I read at night. This one has a light to read by. I bought this Nook because the author Jude Devereaux does v-books and you have to have a Nook color or HD to buy the book.
5,"Mary Bridget Washburn is tired of the direction that her life has taken. Caught up in a life of crime and drugs, she has abandoned her Christian roots, and is desperately seeking a way out. She runs away and tries to start a new life, but her past is only one step behind her. Meanwhile, the home of Rev. Alasdair MacPherson, a widower and father to Samantha and twin infants, is haunted by his wife's death...his life is in shambles and he knows no way to fix it. As this unlikely pair cross paths and discover the plans God has laid out for them, will Mary and Alasdair find peace in the Father, and healing through eachother?  Not a Sparrow Falls is a beautifully written novel that is enthralling and a joy to read. This is a story of redemption and trusting God beyond reason. Forgiveness is heavily themed in this book, both from the Lord and yourself...God is not bound by circumstances. It shows how two very different people can be used to bring meaning to life and straighten eachother's spiritual paths. Author Linda Nichols slowly reveals the past of the characters throughout the book, weaving it all together and making you feel their struggles in life and why they are where they are. This makes for a novel that is hard to put down! I closed this book with a happy and satisfied sigh, and am eager to devour more of Nichols work. Not a Sparrow Falls is about new life and a fresh start...the perfect spring read!  (I was given a copy of this book to review by Bethany House Publishers)"
5,Make sure you know the limits of your devices that you are trying to put the maximum capacity accessories into and in. I knew my phone would accept this card as I had done the research prior. This works fine in an unrooted Verizon Samsung Galaxy Note 2. If you root make sure your kernel supports 64GB cards specifically.
5,"I mounted this in my RV and it holds a 26"" LCD TV / DVD combo.  Installation was very easy and the mount works GREAT!  I was prepared to pay 5 times the price for a mount that would work as I wanted.  I couldn't be happier."
5,"My Galaxy S3 immediately recognized this card with no need to format. The speed is more than acceptable and it has worked flawlessly.  I have also used a Samsung 32g class 10 card with the phone.  For phone mounted use, you won't notice a difference between this card and the class 10 Samsung.  The only time I noticed a difference is when downloading pictures or video externally.  Overall, great card if you are looking for a lot of memory at a decent price point."
5,Great solution to original power cord.  New design gives the cord a better position so that it won't twist and wear out.  Seems to be well made and has stood up to daily use without an issue.
5,quickly shipped to my house and mounted myself. i ordered this for my 32 inch Phillips LCD tv and for the price i paid its a great value. does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do. would recommand
5,"As long as you know how to use a level, a stud finder, a drill, and a wrench you can easily install this mount.  After shopping around at a whole bunch of stores I realized that you couldn't find one for this cheap, so I picked it up and was amazed with how well it was constructed.  Just a note, having 2 people help a lot just to making lining up parts easier."
5,"I teach Mac OS and have been looking for a ""recommended reading"" book for my intermediate Mountain Lion class. This is it.  There is little in this book so specific to laptops that I would hesitate to recommend it to a desk-top only student. It is really about the OS, and it does a beautiful job introducing the power of OSX 10.8. Almost every page of the book contains numerous full-color illustrations that hold the reader's hand while marching them through operations on the Mac. I am experienced in printing costs, and I wonder that a book so laden with color can be offered to the market at such a reasonable price. It also happens to be very well laid out. Clean and simple. You can read it in a crowded, noisy restaurant and follow the argument easily.  The review before mine notes that some of the illustrations are so small as to be difficult to read. This is a fair criticism, but is more than outweighed by the virtues of this very ambitious visual training manual. Considering what the author attempted, this book is a brilliant success. Yes, there are warts, but they are few and not consequential.  If you need a compendious OSX 10.8 resource, I would recommend David Pogue's ""Missing Manual."" If you need to dip your head quickly and effectively into the features of Mountain Lion, I heartily recommend this book.  Be warned, though, that this is not a beginner's book. It assumes basic familiarity with computing in general. And the author has perhaps erred in putting network configuration toward the beginning of the book, which is a challenging subject even to veterans. Don't let this mis-step deter you, however. This book is a great guide to Mac's latest OS, which is well worth studying in depth. I can't recall a book that takes a student farther or faster into a new operating system."
4,"This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7"" to my HDTV through the HDMI cable.  This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook."
5,"With the storyline taking place in Washington State, The Hunt provides a very entertaining read. Linell Jeppsen does an expert job at bringing her characters alive - including the vampire, even though this is no way near your run of the mill vampire story. Just ask the spirit walker.  In reading this story, I found that the storyline so engaging, many a time, I found it easy to forget I was reading a novel instead watching movie playing out in my mind. And there is no doubt, if someone was looking for a novel that's extremely hard to set down once you've started, this is the one to get!  My recommmendation - buy it and start reading, or maybe I should say, mentally watching it today!  Jonathon Waterman - author of the Kindle eBook, ""The Question"""
4,This mount works really well once you get it up and going.  Only problem is just the arms are a little goofy getting them all in the right spot.  But that's really not too big an issue considering all the different TV's and their mounting hole locations.
5,"Brand new condition. Fast shipping. this tablet is the best deal on a 9"" size that you can get. Way better than what the same size cost in my last husband. Easy to use, lots of storage for apps even the large ones. PLUS will hold additional scancard. Beats the Kindle (sorry Amazon) by a mile in functionality, weight and price."
5,"I'm using this with my 32"" tv and I love it. The price is significantly lower than what you can find for monitor wall mounts in the retail stores (walmart, best buy).  I found this to be an easy install and very secure. The swivel is smooth and I can orient my television perfectly. It also has plenty of VESA mount patterns so it will hold just about any TV."
4,Somehow this cord feels better built than the one that originally came with my nook. It is about the same length but if you pair it with a stand of some sort you can charge and watch a movie or read a book at the same time.
5,"This wall mount successfully held my 32-inch LCD TV for over 3 years in my home, with no issues whatsoever. For a price far cheaper than what I could find in the store at the time, I couldn't recommend this product enough! I haven't tried anything heavier than my 32-inch, which weighed about 20 pounds, but it was perfectly sturdy at that weight. The joints all moved freely without being too loose, and I never had an issue positioning the TV just how I wanted it. A great buy!"
5,"The arm is built steady and has a ton of possible holes to fit your TV.  I had to go through many options before finding a combination that my Sony Bravia needed.  I bought a pair of 5/16"" screws that were a little longer (3"") than the lag screws included since I have 1/2"" sheetrock over plaster and furring strips.  I also put some felt on the bracket being fastened to the wall so not to damage the wall.  The arm moves in every direction other than up & down.  Well worth the price paid."
5,"Any product by this company is a hit and well worth the purchase over the high prices for like items in shops like Target or BestBuy.  I have bought 9-10 VideoSecu products over the years and all are extremely well built, easy to install and easy to use.  I will only uy their products from now on for my TV and computer screen mounting needs."
5,"I find so many hidden treasures in the free ebooks. This one is certainly a rare jewel: mult-facited, spell-binding, and in the end, truly beautiful. Beyond that, I dare not share one strand, or the story will unravel."
5,"Very happy with the purchase of the nook.  Wonderful minimalist design lends well to an e-reader - It's easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback (slightly larger, yes, but certainly not as large as the Kindle or the Ipad).  I'm tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective - Yes, we all get electronics that go bad, but really, can't you talk about the functionality of the device a bit?  Anyway, the device isn't perfect (interface not as smooth as the Ipad), but for the price and functionality it's great.  I can read e-books borrowed from my local library, have free 3G service when I'm out and about, and I like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based (avoids fingerprints).  All in all, worth the price."
5,"Write: 7.2 mb/s Read: 11.0 mb/s on LG G2x running Cyanogen 7.2 RC3. All 59 gb available. Best Current Value ( May 2012) for microsd card  Go for it, you won't regret it!"
5,"Out of the box she knew how to operate it, and is working fine getting a lot of use as she likes reading.  Glad to see as she is only 8 years old.  Bill"
1,"I received the product today (4/26), and when installed into my Samsung Galaxy Note 8, a message stated ""this device must be formatted"", but another message stated ""unable to format this device"". The Samsung rep I purchased this tablet from said the product will definitely take an 64GB SDHC or SDXC.  I was successful in getting a 32 GB SDHC card to work."
2,"This tv wall mount is an example of you get what you pay for.  It does the job and is sturdy when tightened down so the TV isn't going any where.  The problem is that the TV level is different when the wall mounts arm is extended or retracted.  If you level the TV with the arm retracted so the the TV is against the wall the TV will be slanted when you pull the arm out to full extension, and vise versa.  I ended up purchasing a Wall mount for twice the money but with non of the problems."
5,"I asked for this e-reader for Christmas due to seeing it in a Barnes and Noble store and learning about its features. It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.  Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, ""user error,"" but B&N staff was happy to provide a new one for me.  It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this ""bendy plastic"" business.  Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less."
5,"I previously purchased a no name brand from another website, but when it arrived it did not work in my phone.  I sent it back for a refund and purchased the SanDisk from Amazon.  When it arrived, it worked right out of the box.  Excellent and I will order again if I need another one (my camera also takes them and the price has come down since I purchased a 32 gb three years ago."
5,This thing cost alot but i now have over 200 Cd's at my finger tips with my galaxy so im happy the only thing is it's kind of hard to get out of the adapter maybe its me i don't know but i love this card. P.s. Only Around 58 to 60 useable space on it.
5,"I love this product. I was on the hunt for an imexpensive tablet / ereader and because if the brand and price point i decided to try this one and I am completely please. it doesnt take long to fully charge. i haven't timed it but the battery lasts a reasonable amount of time i think 6hrs if not more and i mean with continuous use. The images are bright, its possible to use it in direct sunlight with minimum glare. its durable. The only issue that i noticed is that it lags on websites with a lot of images. nevertheless i am happy with the nook and i would recommend it to everyone."
5,"this is excellent tablet, excellent touch screen response and button controls. When you hold it in your hand, you will feel that its built tough and can withstand rough handling(my 17m old tosses it sometimes out of excitement and its still holding good). Battery is also good, last about 8+ hours; the old drawback is that there are very limited apps on Noon web, but I heard there's a way to sideload adds from Amazon that I haven't tried yet. But yes, I would highly recommend it."
5,"I already had power converters and really only needed the cables, but at this price, why not just get both pieces and save the converters for backup? The set is OEM B&N, so I know I can count on it being correct. I have been burned before on non OEM cables, and  didn't want that to happen again.  This cable is for my Nook HD+, and both work just as expected. What is not to like?  Highly recommended."
5,"I came across this 'Lightening Deal' by accident and i am so happy i did. This is great for anyone who needs more memory on their digital camera, smartphone, or tablet. Most Android tablets only accept up to 32GB, but this is not the case. In actuality, this card is usuable on all android devices. The only thing is, it must be formatted first. It will not work right out of the box. Good thing i had an old Samsung Vibrant phone lying around the house. It was running Android 2.2 and it gave me the option to format this card, as soon as i popped it in. It only took 2 seconds to format and now works in all my Android devices. I popped this into my Android 3.0 tablet and it would NOT format the card, so i feel very fortunate to have my Samsung Vibrant handy. I really needed this extra memory for my HTC View tablet, so that i can add more movies on it. The tablet came with 32GB installed and now has over 90GB thanks to this little Sandisk guy. Apple is so stingy with memory and now my tablet has more memory than the most expensive iPad that's available. This card also functions great for turning a smartphone into an iPod Touch replacement. It was on sale for fifty bucks and so worth it. I don't recommend buying this if it cost more. SD cards can get extremely pricey. I only wish this came in 120GB.  **Also, i would not purchase this SD card from any other seller besides Amazon. I have had bad experiences from other sellers and their SD cards appeared to either be used or bootlegs because they did not come in proper Sandisk packaging**  **On a sad note, this SD card does NOT work on my Blackberry 9900 and i wish it did**"
5,"I've been using this book to help my mom transition from PC to Mac. She's kind of technophobic--which is the reason for the switch--and she's also the type of person who feels better if there's a manual to refer to. So far so good.  The book goes beyond teaching you how to use the computer itself, it also includes things like how to use email, the internet and various applications. Even if you need to learn how to upload movies to YouTube, use Bluetooth or set up a wireless network, it's all here.  I highly recommend it to both Windows-switchers and Mac users; it can be used as either a training guide or a reference book."
4,"It works!  I was skeptical about ordering it because the ratings weren't great, but short of buying a new Nook or replacing it with a Kindle,  it was the best short-term option.  The original plug-in part made a sizzling sound one night and stopped working.  My husband tried to plug the USB end into one of about 20 USB to plug-in wall chargers that we have around the house and none of them worked.  We're assuming there must be some proprietary thing with the Nook USB end that won't let you use generic wall chargers which really sucked because he couldn't use his Nook for weeks.  If you are contemplating purchasing a Nook,  it may be something to take into consideration."
2,"The fact that the pivot point on this TV mount was not built straight caused the TV to tilt slightly when it was swung out.  there is no adjustment for it, so i had to make a choice for the tv to either be straight and level when it was pushed against the wall, or when it was out.  i do not recommend this wall mount.  to it's benefit though, it was reasonably sturdy and easy to install."
5,"Bought this for my EVO 4G LTE.  It gave my phone more storage space than the iPhone (including the non-removable storage on my phone).  This easily held my music collection (which is in a lossless format) with plenty of room to spare.  Why anyone that is comfortable with technology would buy an iPhone is beyond me, but to each their own....  This card still lets me use the fancy picture-taking features of my EVO 4G LTE (pictures with no pause between them), so I assume the card's speed is not an issue."
5,"Made in china, but this time , its well made. nice and sturdy and lots of options to mount differenct type of LCD. It has a good viewing set of angles and can be adjusted just about any view you want. the value for cost here is big, since most of these sale for over 75.00, or over 100.00 at wm. im pleased with it."
5,I use this for my Group Pro Hero 4 Silver. It can hold over 2 hours of video on a high setting. This is way cheaper than any retail store so don't get fooled into paying triple the cost! At this price get two especially if you have more than one battery.
5,"I own a few of these.  They are good solid microsd cards, and work in most devices, even ones that say they only support up to 32GB cards.  Sadly, one I bought ended up having an issue, where it was stuck in read only mode.  I could access and copy the data off it no problem, but could make no changes at all.  For example, no deleting of data (the files/directories would appear to be deleted, and then revert back), no new data (would disappear), and the drive could not be formatted (would error out).  Trying to run repair utilities on it would also fail.  The great thing about Sandisk, and why I use their cards almost exclusively, is that I was able to go online and fill out a warranty claim, and in less than 48 hours they sent me a postage paid mailing label to return the faulty card to them for a replacement.  While the prices for sandisk microsd cards are often among the cheapest anyway, it's worth paying a bit more to buy from a company that stands by their products 100% and makes things so easy and quick for their customers who do happen to experience a rare problem.  I'm a loyal sandisk customer, and Sandisk is loyal to their customers who trust them with their data storage needs."
5,"I had to format it after putting it into the phone but it works great and I have a ton of space. If you're looking for a 64gb sd card for your Note then look no further. I have about 40gb worth of data on it already and it doesn't have any issue reading any of it. If you don't mind spending the money for it, then this may be the card for you."
5,"I will buy another anytime soom.  Be awarded...  I bought it second handed and bought a 32gb one, got the 16gb version.  At least it included a cover.  Next time I buy something second handed I will buy the smaller capacity possible. Anyways I give 5 stars cause I love the cover."
5,A well written story of two people finding their own hearts while searching for one another's.  Settings of the story descriptions put you there as yo read.  A great story by wonderful author.
5,"Bought this for my then fiance now my wife 2 years ago. and this was such a bargain back then! it had a killer resolution (and STILL comparable to the ""retina display"" ipad airs), and google play store. few months ago, i install cyanogenmod on it, and it runs the latest version of android flawlessly. sure, it didn't have a camera, but do you really use a camera on a tablet? (do people realize how ridiculous they look taking a picture with a tablet?). my only regret is not buying another one earlier. now that b&n stopped making them, the prices on these tablets and the cables seemed to have skyrocketed. oh the one big downside is the proprietary cable. other than that, this guy is golden."
4,"My main intent in getting this particular book was for my wife, who has a MacBook (we both have iMacs - for which much information is still applicable). Keep in mind that this book is written with Snow Leopard as the intended OS, but there is not much difference from Leopard, if that is what you have.  Her impressions:  *Has easy step-by-step instructions with numbered illustrations  *Helpful hints/tips/shortcuts  *Easy to read for the lay person (not heavy with tech jargon)  *Covers wide variety of topics  *High quality, portable reference  My impression is that one cannot go wrong with purchasing this as a guide to the Mac/MacBook, especially if one is highly accustomed to Windows or a much earlier version of Mac OS, though all Macs come with helpful guides within the system that can be found in Spotlight or Help. The Apple website has many sources of helpful information, also, such as tutorials."
5,"You continue to live in the characters long after you finish the book.  There is such a variety of characters, there is someone in it you will identify with.  Story moves along very quickly but you can't wait to see what is going to happen next.  Good book for young adults who may be trying to make some decisions in their lives."
5,it works perfectly on my transformer prime tablet with no issues or no setup required.  I just plugged it in to the micro sd slot and turned on my transformer and it saw it right away.  I use the SD adapter to load stuff on from my mac.  I plan to try and use the 64 gb card in my camera with the adapter. i'll pst back once I've tried that.
5,"This was exactly what it said it was, the genuine article.  Our old charger cord died, and we needed a new one right away.  We tried another less expensive one, but it broke almost immediately.  I'm sure this one will last for years to come."
5,I won't lie i didn't love the beginning and it took me a while to go back because the beginning turned me off a few times but once i let the story fill me i couldn't get enough i have read this one at least three times not skipping any part like they are all new love it.
1,"I have gone thru a lot of reviews of this eBook before ordering it, mainly due to its long battery life. Within a week, it got shipped home (excellent seller). However, the product itself is far from being a good eBook Reader. I have had two: one Kindle eBook reader (with keyboard) and one 10.2"" Android tablet that I used as a reader mainly. The Nook is cumbersome:  THE BADS: 1) the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement, then click ACCEPT !!! (like I am installing a new software !!!) 2) the second thing is to setup for a WIFI access, I have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day. Can't do anything until WIFI access is established.  THE GOODS 3) I went to a local B&N store to get instant WIFI access which I did,  THE BAD 4) then create an account, enter my credit card number (why do I need to do this at this time). Should only ask when I first order something from B&N.  THE GOOD: 5) now I can copy my eBook in PDF formats to it, this part is straightforward.  THE BAD: 6) I opened one of my PDF doc and it came up with a huge font size 7) try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size, the menu appears, then quickly disappears. I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there 8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size. The text now reads fine. But the ""next page"" , ""previous page"" buttons are too hard to push, it takes a hard push to get it to work.  9) I close the document and try to open another one, it won't open 10) try to re-open the first one, not open either From this point on, it simply refused to open any document I have on it.  11) I even convert one PDF to epub format (specifically target the Nook)  and load on it, does not open either. And the epub size is much larger than PDF size (i.e. I will have a lot less books on it).  To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today. And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for ""firwmare operated"" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these ""Software/firmware"" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).  I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good. I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.  My older two eBook readers work right of the box. Just copy the documents to it and open to read them. I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.  I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing). Rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work. Many users were lucky to get the ones that work (touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here), I was not and don't want to try my luck with it again."
5,"I've researched the readers for about two years. I only buy electronics after I can give the item a test drive. Upon that note, I have always been a huge fan of Amazon. For the first time I could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question.   The nook was available to be put through anything I wanted to try. First of all the new Nook in stores has the most recent upgrades. No problem with turning the page at all,touch screen worked great. In the store I downdoaded a book in under 1 minute and have downloaded 3 books at home that are nearly 1000 pages long in under 1 minute.   The nook can connect to your computer (as does the Sony). You can also download from other sources other than the dealer.   The nook also downloads without any effort wi-fi ( as does the Kindle).   The nook's battery you can change at home. It also accepts a memory card, which allows you to expand your book collection.   The Nook also has other advantages,but I was only wanted a reliable reader.   Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package."
5,"I was looking at expensive tablets that were more like mini notebook computers. I already have a high end notebook. I wanted something that was very portable and not combersome to take on trips, go to coffee shops and etc. I wanted the ability to get email, do limited surfing and read books. The Nook works flawlessly and the display is really nice. I have an N protocol router and the Nook is quick on the Net. I read some negative reviews here. They appear to be written by folks who want to take a $200 unit and turn it into a $500 unit with various apps and other applications. Here's a news flash for the naysayers. Go out and buy the $500 unit and quit complaining. If you want to read books, surf and get email, you'll like this unit."
5,"I love my Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light.  I'm an avid reader, often reading in bed.  My husband would complain that the light was preventing him from going to sleep.  I can now read until my heart is content and my husband doesn't complain about it.  I take it with me on international trips and can read without disturbing my seat mate with the overhead light."
5,"Good quality for the price. Actually does go 24 inches from the base to the vesa mount. Not quite enough to turn a thin bezel 55"" tv 90 degrees but 70 degrees is good enough for me."
5,"Ordered this to use the THX Tune-Up app on my LG G3 phone for our new 4K tv.  Plugged it in, set HDMI input and followed the directions.  Cable worked great!  That is the only time I have used it so far, so cannot comment on longevity.  But for this purpose, it worked perfectly."
5,"I was very happy with this mount for my situation. I mounted a 50"" Vizio to it that is about 35 lbs. No issues at all with the weight and it moves easily just as I needed."
5,"I was shooting blindly when I purchased this along with my tv just hoping it'd work. I'm a firm believer in 'you get what you pay for' and i was thinking '25$, compared to the 120$ at Best Buy... this won't work'. However I figured what the hell, with amazons amazing return policy I figured I couldn't lose. This mount works like a dream. I have it holding my 32"" tv in the corner of the room. It supports the weight even though the arm on the wall, is about 10"" from the attached tv. It doesn't sag at all.  You can't go wrong. I'm contemplating picking up some more for my computer monitors. This mount is perfect."
5,"Purchased for a cell phone, Sprint HTC EVO LT. I was apprehensive as Sprint said the phone would only support 32 GB card, I had read reviews that stated otherwise. Yes, my phone supports this card, works flawlessly."
5,"I have been eyeballing e-readers for a while and I was absolutely certain that I was going to purchase a Kindle.  Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.' After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file. I can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook. In short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.  The charge holds for a pretty long time, I haven't measured it in time myslef. It is simple to use, very friendly and there is an incredible book selection for the Nook.  i happen to be a big fan of classic literature and Russian literature and I have had no trouble filling up my library.  Storage capacity is quite large and i have an additional micro SD card just in case, but I am no where near filling up my storage yet. The books are also available on my personal computer, and if I decide to archive a book, but do not necessarily want to delete the title altogether, I can archive it and later retrieve that title from my online account.  Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.  Recommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.  The only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen."
2,"This book is beautifully laid out, visually clear and not too verbose.  However when I received this, I was running Leopard, not Snow Leopard.  This is not so much about using a MacBook on any platform, but rather using a MacBook running Snow Leopard.  Regardless of this, there were other limitations.  Overall this seemed to focus on accomplishing very basic tasks - common to all computers, Mac or PC - which Mac does so intuitively that I'm surprised this was the focus of the book.  I was looking for information on very specific Mac-things, such as Time Machine, how security works specifically on a Mac (i.e., no virus software), keyboard differences and shortcuts.  That sort of thing.  Mac has a lot of these, some of which are not immediately apparent to a former PC user, and I was frustrated by this lack.  This book would be best for someone with a new MacBook who is not that computer savvy on any platform.  For someone who is reasonably computer literate, this is much too simplistic, predominantly covering Snow Leopard topics that I feel most computer-literate people could readily figure out themselves...even if they've never had a Mac.  I'm donating it.  :-("
5,I am currently using this for a 46in LCD CRT RCA tv. It mounted easily and also attached to the tv easily. Motion is nice and is very sturdy. Feel perfectly comfortable trusting this on the wall
5,"At first I was torn between the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Paperwhite. I chose the Nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book. I had though that the Nook did not have a good dictionary function, but learned otherwise after it's purchase. All one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the Look Up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left.  Sharp resolution, useful utilities, convenient scrolling functions both off on the side of and on the screen. Lightweight, durable and well designed. Essay to download free books (I suggest Project Gutenberg). For downloading free books from on line sites or from the library, you will need to download Adobe Digital Edition 2 software which is free.  I suggest that you purchase additional memory. Barnes and Noble only allocates 1/4 of a GIG out of 2GIG for your personal library from non Barnes and Noble books. One gig for software to run the Nook and 3/4 for books purchased from Barnes. The best buy for external memory is 8 GIG. I also suggest that your purchase one CaseCrown leather Regal flip case sold through Amazon; they are high quality for a reasonable price."
5,"It's a Nook, they are great! This one features a backlit screen which means you can read it in bed without keeping anyone awake. My only complaint is the clunky software to transfer books off a computer. I'm sure this has been remedied in newer versions, but aside from that this is a great alternative to a regular tablet which can bother some people's eyes from prolonged reading. The lack of glare is also very nice. Can't say that about your iPad when you try looking at it in any kind of sunlight!"
5,"This book kept my attention.  Rye is a troubled soul who rediscovers the meaning of love and family.  Rory is a special kid-- super observant, smart with a lot of love for his family --especially his little sister and Tory.  I enjoyed this book."
5,I got this so I could use the Xfinity app from my Nook HD+ running CM11 and it works ok it does not fill the screen 100% but it is still worth it.
5,Dont diss this book. It was a heart warming story that gave a real perspective of a terrifying war. I know what searching for someone that you know deep down won't return feels like. My best friend died an I am still searching as young Connie and lovable Charlie-mouse did for Malcolm
5,"A very good story.  It was maybe somewhat predictable, but had a nice story to it and a lesson learned too.  A good all around story.  I would read more books by this author."
2,"I have an older URC-WR7 remote and thought this would be an upgrade (and because TWC stuck me with it), but this one fails where the other one didn't.  The old remote could go head to head and learn.  I have 2 different Blu Ray players (LG & Panasonic) and this one fails on both.  It cannot learn buttons.  The biggest problem is in streaming when I need to hit the blue, red, yellow, green buttons.  These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning."
1,This product is just poor quality. It didn't work most of the time and it seemed that the connection was loose. There's too many things that have to be done to set this thing up. Skip this product.
4,"First, this book was sent to me through a connection on LinkedIn in exchange for a review here.  My MacBook is a great book for anyone new to the Mac, or anyone who just likes having a great basic book for random questions that come up. I was very impressed with how detailed and easy to follow the directions are. Personally, I wouldn't have the patience to get into so much detail! On this point, kudos to the author. This covers everything from setting up a new MacBook to sharing files, folders, and printers, and just about anything you can think of in between.  It's very thorough. The author and editors spent a lot of time not only on detail, but also organizing the content in a way that makes sense to anyone picking it up. It's easy to read through, and it's easy to find a nugget for help here and there.  My only kvetch with the book is that this detail and thoroughness does come with a price: this is a dry read and there wasn't much effort to inject humor or entertainment. So if you like humor in your computer books check out David Pogue.  That said, this is still a good book for new Mac owners, and seasoned ones. I picked up a couple of tips I hadn't seen before and I've been using Macs for 5 years.  You won't be disappointed with the content and will become comfortable and productive on your Mac."
5,"This item serves its purpose as well as any other mount.  Its most appealing attribute is its large range of motion.  I am using this to corner-mount a 32"" TV and it works perfectly to hide the mount, receptacles, and cables behind the TV.  Very easy installation as well."
4,"So this is a very simple, paper-bound album with a nice photo of a retro camera for the front cover. The covers are thick and strong, but the sheets and film to hold the photos are thin, so you wouldn't want to replace the photos often. There is a thoughtful elastic strap to keep it closed, but I'm not sure how long that would last with everyday usage. Ultimately, it's $10 so there's not really anything to complain!"
5,"When one of the wonderfully authentic characters in Brad Marlowe's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepwalker-The-Last-Sandman/dp/B002RHP4N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepwalker: The Last Sandman</a>&nbsp;says, ""...if I tell you and if you believe... your lives will never be the same again"" he means it! Hold on tight to your hat and your wits as Marlowe takes you for a wild ride on the roller coaster of his rich and effervescent imagination. The book will keep your mind whirling between its artfully described nightmares and its exhilarating and boisterous heroism, while it stops short of stimulating true nightmares. You'll be delighted to meet the character who proudly declares ""By the age of ten I had awakened myself from a dead sleep with laughter so often...that my mother took me to a psychologist..."" Fortunately you can read this delightful adventure by daylight or lamplight, unlike the magical Book of Dreams that holds the bones of the main story and can only be read by starlight.  Marlowe is a first rate storyteller who intertwines adventure and fantasy with thought provoking revelations. Sprinkled judiciously throughout the book are brief supporting stories which will equally delight and enlighten. While ""Sleepwalker: The Last Sandman"" sits comfortably in the same niche as the works of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, Marlowe holds true to his own unique creative vision. I think you'll agree with me that Marlowe delivers  ""...a happy ending that gives me exactly what I want, but in a way that I never expected."" And that's a promise."
5,"My daughter came home from college and arranged her bedroom like her dorm room with a sitting area and a sleeping area. She likes to watch the one TV in both areas and this worked out perfect.  Adjusts easy and fit our 32"" flat screen without a problem."
5,"The Nook Tablet is a solid hybrid tablet/eBook reader.  It excels at eBook reading, and has many functions as a tablet as well.  This is a minor upgrade for Nook Color owners, but a major upgrade for those going from the Nook or Kindle eInk display reader.  Pros:  7"" VividView IPS touchscreen, bonded for glare reduction.  This is the best IPS screen on the market in this class of device. MicroSD card slot, for up to 32GB of extra storage. Built-in Microphone for voice recording, particularly usefull to ""read"" books to your children without having to physically be there. Reliable Wifi card. 1 GB built in RAM for smooth, fast video. Netflix and Hulu. eReader bests the competitions. Easy to root, if that is something you would do.  Cons:  It's $50 more than some low end hybrids. Much like the other low end tablet's, it runs on Android, which is not the best tablet experience. Limited apps, although the list expands almost daily.  Overall, this is a great device and although it is $50 more than some of the competitors models, it is also a far more refined product which doesn't have many of the problems of the others.  Highly recommended!"
5,"I used this mount for putting a 42"" LCD screen on a wall.  It is a solid and sturdy mount.  I was extremely pleased by the quality.  Hex head lag screws that are included which are a breeze to drive into the stud.  I purchased a mount previously that had a phillips head on the lag screws and that really made them a job to drive into the stud.  Since the TV was rather large (400x400 vesa mounting pattern) I had to use the extension arms off of the main plate as shown in the picture.  They were surprisingly very easy to attach.  A nice plastic cover is included which slides back over the wall mounting plate to conceal the mounting screws - I thought that was a nice touch.  Overall an excellent product and I would easily purchase another if I had another TV to wall mount."
5,"I fawned over an ereader for a long time before purchasing one.  My top two choices were the Sony E-Reader and the Nook. I would have purchased a Sony e-reader instead but the Sony ereader refreshes on every screen and that doesn't sit well with many of the hacked apps that I wanted to use.  My main reasons for purchasing a Nook over the Kindle (or anything else) is that this Nook has a glowlight, a micro sd slot, and it has a lot of 3rd party support for hacking. I rooted using NookManager (look for the thread on XDA forums) and it was very easy."
5,"I am using this with our very high 4th grade students and they are loving the book.  I found a resource online that is helping them analyze the characters/setting/themes/etc. and learn about foreshadowing and flashback. They are enjoying the story because it isn't just another WWII story about the Nazis.  Instead, it is WWII when Japan invated Burma."
5,"Its sturdy, holds my tv really good, its adjustable & really really easy to install. An excellent product. I would definitely recommend it.  ] I bought this mount on Feb, 2014. Today is 20 Nov, 2016!!! I never thought I would write something for a TV MOUNT again, after 2 & half years!!! Well, here I am! Amazed AGAIN! I was watching a 32"" Samsung LCD. Its a old TV, today I replaced it with a 50"" Samsung 4K LED. I didn't use those 4 extender arms on my 32"" TV, so I kept it on my basement store room. Today, fortunately I found them with all necessary screws!!! Mannn! This thing is amazing. Within this price, they delivered a very sturdy, swivel mount with all necessary screws & washers! My 50"" TV needed a different & bigger screws and I found it in this wall mount's box!!! This is awesome, this THE best ever $30 I've invested. The mount holding my bigger 50"" TV without any problem! & I can adjust it easily. Once again, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this inexpensive yet amazing wall mount to any one."
5,"I've never been remotely interested in e-book readers, but I was stuck in Best Buy during a car installation for hours the other month and saw this device. It's just about the only time I've discovered something not by hype or searching for a product to fit my needs but by wandering upon it in an electronics store. After reading about the new reader for a few weeks, I decided to actually buy one.  At this point, I've found it to be a really excellent device and the only thing remotely ""tablet"" that's appealed to my needs. I find it easy to use with one of the first touch screen keyboards that recognizes my non-dainty mitts (I kind of hate touch screens as a rule). I feel like the makers of this device understand how ADD our society has made us, and most complaints about the firmware's limited capacity to check e-mail, surf the web, and play tiny games are music to my ears. I just want electronic paper... for reading.  Some bullet points about this e-reader, some of which stand it apart from competitors like the current Kindle:  * 215 grams * No physical keyboard and low affinity of touch screen to oil * Battery life (obviously) - leave the wi-fi off * Maps true page numbers to print equivalent, should you cite or alternate between print and e-book * Supports non-proprietary formats that can be downloaded from Project Gutenberg, torrent sites, etc. * E-book library lending  It's one of the last things I mentioned, but the high compatibility of formats on the Nook is absolutely indispensable to me. I would never purchase a reader that required payment for content, just like I wouldn't mail publishers a check every time I borrowed a library book or a novel from a friend. Use your own morals. A big thanks to B&N for producing an intelligent device."
4,"when i first bought this didn't think it was really gonna work.  I have a 32 inch tv though and this has been holding it for over two months and its still steady and equipped.  When you move the tv from side to side it shakes a little bit, but this is a good product for the price.  I am very pleased"
5,"This was half the price of the TV mounts at Costco and perfectly fits a Vizio 37"" TV for the spare bedroom. It will work with many different brands so in my book that is great. Strong, sturdy and robust."
4,This works well and was easy to install. The only thing I don't like is that it tilts forward a little bit and I can't figure out how to stop it.
5,This tablet is awesome...it took me 10 minutes to root it and turn it into a complete Android tablet legally...i did this without changing anything that originally came with the tablet...so now i have the barnes & nobles  tablet with full Android market...best of both worlds...simply awesome
5,"Could have done without so much detail in the sexual escapades and the foul language did not help the story line. Overall I enjoyed the book!!  The story line held many twists and turns.  I was forced to buy the second book in the series to found out the ""leak"". Love it as muchm"
4,"This book provides a good overview of the features of the MacBook, the MadBook Pro and the MacBook Air and what can be done with Snow Leopard, the latest Mac operating system.  Frankly since Macs are so intuitive, such a book is probably not needed by anyone who has worked with any other Mac computers previously and is therefore only essential for those new to the Mac platform, i.e. former Windoze users.  What I found most  useful was the manner in which each featured action was accompanied by a numbered illustration.  Basically when trying to use a new feature you only have to be able to read the numbered sentence and then find the corresponding number on the adjacent illustration.  What I did not like is that many of the illustrations and their accompanying writing were so small that I needed to use my reading glasses in order to see them in full detail.  While this size issue was probably made necessary by the relatively small dimensions of the book itself, the publisher should have realized that many new MacBook users may be older persons.  As the parent of a teenager I know that younger Mac users, even first-time ones, cannot be bothered to take the time to read instructional books such as this one and thus I suspect that this book will be mainly used by the slightly older reader.  If I am correct, the publisher should have taken the size issue into account.  That it was not done is the only reason why I have dropped my rating of this otherwise serviceable book down to four stars."
5,"I selected the black and white NOOK over the Kindle because I can download books from public libraries to my laptop and copy them to the NOOK.  We travel full time in our RV, and I have library cards in three states.  I can always find books I want to read from the libraries.  I haven't bought a book since I bought the NOOK four months ago.  The display is incredible.  I sit in the sun and read a lot, and the brighter the sunlight, the better the display.  Try that with a traditional LCD display.  Since the black and white NOOK has no backlight for the book pages, it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book.  In dim lighting I use a clip-on book light, as I did with paper books.  While I can use the NOOK several hours a day for several days between charges, an hour or two a day of charging keeps it charged.  The NOOK Color has a much shorter battery life, as well as being heavier.  The 3G option for the NOOK is a waste of money unless you want to buy books and magazines directly from Barnes & Noble, or if you want to try to use the NOOK as a tablet computer.  It really doesn't have the horsepower for that."
3,"Go to Target or Barnes and Noble instead, and pay $25 (which is still a huge markup, considering they make the thing for 50 cents.) This is the worst option if you need one of these. It's price gouging, pure and simple."
4,"It took about 10 mins to install this TV Wall Mount with a 48 inch Samsung TV.  It does the job, there are much more expensive arms, but this does the trick."
5,"I lost my original Nook so looked at Barnes & Noble for a replacement. Now they don't stock this model, so bought it here. It has an SD card slot which I wanted & the newer model from B&N doesn't have."
5,"I have the white Nook HD+ 7"" 16GB tablet and absolutely love it! I've been using it for a year now and it's performed perfectly. Still downloads fast, games play well, screen looks great, and has a long battery life. The only issue I have is that the nook only plays a few video formats. They should work on that."
4,"seems like a bit flimsy for the larger models  Pros: easy to install articulating arm will work with the smaller size perfectly  Cons larger TV's could have an issue being heavier  overall if you have a smaller TV under 45"" it is a 5 star, otherwise 4 stars"
4,"This is a great truck GPS. I've tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.  Excellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.  I'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.  My complaints are relatively minor:  Battery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.  The announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.  There is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot. Annoying.  Clean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rand-McNally-528881469-7-inch-Intelliroute-TND-700-Truck-GPS/dp/0528881469/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rand McNally 528881469 7-inch Intelliroute TND 700 Truck GPS</a>"
4,"My MacBook is good, general book and all things MacBook (and by default OS X). It is thorough in its coverage of every regular type of task or operation that anyone would need to do with their MacBook and it includes full color step by step instructions that will walk you through each task or operation and will help you get comfortable with OS X and your MacBook and become proficient in all the routine things that you will use your MacBook for. This includes managing your network and internet access, managing and customizing your desktop and menu bar, playing music and video, sharing files and accessing shared files over a network, sharing hardware such as printers and scanners, recording, editing, publishing video to various media including websites such as YouTube, setup and manage a MobileMe account, securing your data, troubleshooting problems with OS X, using Safari and Mac Mail, communicating with iChat, and much more.  I found this book to be clear and easy to use and would recommend it to anyone wanting to get the most out of their MacBook.  >>>>>>><<<<<<<  A Guide to my Book Rating System:  5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way. 4 stars = Good book, but not life altering. 3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted. 2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead. 1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper."
5,"Works perfectly in my Xperia Z2, at least it did after formatting. Do that first or things will start disappearing at random. It's nice to have my entire mp3 library with me without an internet connection."
5,Item rec'd very quickly and was just as described. This same item is sold at the big boxes for three or four times the price. Included was enough hardware to fill a store and additional brackets to hang most any flat screen TV..
5,"My sister and over 10 of my friends have payed over $100.00 for one of the same mount at many of named brand stores I bought 2 of the same wall mounts for way less then what they paid for one ""Great job AMAZON your site is one no the best.."
5,B&N was all sold out online and in stores. Product is perfect. I share this with my 5-year-old and he's super happy because we both get our own profiles so he doesn't have to look at my books/apps and I don't have to look at his lol Love it!
4,"It is up know and should work fine, but it was hard to get it to fit my TV due to the bulge on the bottom, but I made it work and it is on the wall."
4,"This was well priced, sturdy, easy to install.  You have to mount it on a stud in the wall. The mount joints are stiff.  Even though there is a generous pack of screws of various lengths and washers, I still had to improvise to mount the television. Good value"
5,"I've used a nook simple touch for a long time now, at least a year, and I've always loved it but hated that I had to have a light on to read at night (this isn't the stone age, we have the technology) so I got myself the simple touch with glowlight for christmas and I LOVE it highly recommend it to any avid readers out there!  screen resolution is wonderful, as is the battery life"
1,"What is with all the 4 and 5 star reviews? This mount is atrocious!  Installation isn't too bad. But you do need 2 people for this.  As for quality... there is none. It's the epitome of ""Made in China"". It's extremely flimsy and I was so afraid to keep my TV mounted on this thing that I returned it to Amazon.  Rotating the TV on this is also VERY hard. I think you have a good chance of breaking your TV if you rotate it too many times on this thing. You have to use a LOT of force to get it to move.  DO NOT GET THIS. For $18 I should have known better. You're paying for spray painted metal and some screws.  However, if you don't need to rotate your TV, this will do the job I suppose"
5,A 64GB (Class 6 or Higher) Memory Card gives you the room in your Memory to record the Highest Quality Video Possible on your Road Hawk and plenty of Room to record  ** Memory cards like SanDisk are always reliable ........ unlike some cloned ones ***
5,"We're rough on cables, often breaking them at the connection after a few months. This one eliminates that as a possibility, and a year later, we still haven't broken it!"
5,"I have tried the IPad, the Kindle, and the Sony, and nothing has worked better than this Nook Tablet. It's light, the screen resolution is amazing for movies, and the applications I use work beautifully. Even the speakers are excellent for what they are. No complaints at all."
5,"This is the best novel I have read in 2 or 3 years.  It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop ""my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me"" trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are. Anyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature. I was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh... I hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work."
5,"I received the Nook as a Christmas present.  I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.  I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders. Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them) As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker. Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface. If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.  Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook."
5,"Purchased this for a small 22 in TV for bedroom. The mount weighs more than the TV ! That's not a complaint though. I actually took down the 22 inch set today and mounted a 37in Sharp Aquos. Much heavier set than 22 in, no issues at all. It supports the 37 in just fine. The set probably weighs 35-40 lbs. For the price, $25,it was a great bargain. Installed it myself into wall studs,very secure."
5,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more ""manly"" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!"
5,My wife have the older version of this Nick that was not backlit. She she told me she wanted this one and totally loves it. Now she's about to break me buying books all the time but it is well worth it. It's all so much cheaper than buying it in the stores anywhere. Great product.
5,"My bedroom is set up so that my bed faces a window. I needed to mount my TV on the side wall and have it swing over so I can watch TV when I fall asleep. I was a little nervous about having my TV dangling off of one of these mounts. I've had it mounted (into a stud, of course) for about 2 years now with no problems. I'm still always nervous about it because the TV seems so heavy. Hopefully I did a good enough job installing the mount! I'll let you know if it ever stops working (aka falls!)."
5,"""I fell through the hole in the sky"" I loved this line!!  Enjoyed this book very much. I look forward to reading it to my grandchildren when they get a bit older. I would compare it to the Never Ending Story, Alice in Wonderland, and a Twilight Zone episode All wrapped up in one. This would really make a great movie.  I will keep an eye out for more from this Author. I do not have much to critique and will leave that to the ""professionals"" but if you want an entertaining book to keep you guessing, then click the buy now button."
5,"Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need."
5,"You don't need a lamp to see and the light is adjustable.  You can extend battery life by using the light only when you need it and keeping it reduced to what you actually need for brightness.  If you want something other than a ebook reader then don't buy this product.  If you want to read an ebook, then I highly recommend this reader."
5,"Great for its long arm. I was able to turn my 50"" Vizio TV totally to the right (90 degrees). The edge of the TV was just barely touching the wall. Sturdy enough if you get the bolts in the center of a good stud or better yet into a 4x4 column."
5,"Predators of Darkness is my first exposure to Leonard D. Hilley II.  I don't know Mr. Hiley, but I want readers to know what a special person he is.  He discovered that I am a retired Marine and sent me all 3 of his books and gave me permission to forward them to military veterans free of charge.  Although I am not used to reading Sci-Fi novels, I was pleasantly surprised at this author's skill in character development as well as keeping the readers on the edge on their seat frantically flipping pages to see what was going to happen next.  The major characters of this story are Daniel Hutchinson and his best friend Lucas Ridale and his clone.  The year is 2073 in Pittsburg. The city has been attached by nuclear warheads and Dr. Helmsby (genetics genius) behind the scenes saves the lives of college students and scientists from the evil TransGenCorp  General Idris who is behind the attack and the creation of ""shifters"" and programmed assassin clones that are genetically altered green eyed creatures of various sizes who rape, kill and eat humans.  Daniel and Lucas fight and kill shifters in their missions to search and resupply their comrades held up in a building housing the college laboratories.  General Idris uses clones to plot and infiltrate the Helmsby's fortress.  Helmsby learns that that there is a normal life in the world outside their entrapment in a limited portion in Pittsburg; however, their likelihood of survival is unlikely.  Predator of Darkness ends leaving the reader hungry to read the next in the series, Beyond the Darkness. If you are looking for an action packed novel that will leave you wanting to read more from an author, THIS IS IT!"
5,"Whoo boy, can this guy write! I laughed. I cried. Well, I laughed, anyway, and kept turning the pages, devouring the words as I went. Christmas Eve Can Kill You is a clever, laugh-out-loud, edge-of-the-seat murder mystery, a first novel from a gifted Canadian author who writes with wicked humor, knife-edge intelligence, and a strong point of view that brings alive the culture and calamities of life above the border in the depressing Winnipeg winter.  Marantz is head and shoulders above the rest in this crowded genre. His eccentric humor and crystal clear prose are what you might get if you crossed Jasper Fford with Michael Chabon. His energetic writing pulls you by the collar through a tangled plot that he deftly untwists. Val Virgo, failed country singer and indifferent talk-show host, is as unforgettable as that screwball friend who used to crack you up in school. Marantz creates heroes who are flawed and bad guys have good parts, and you end up believing them all.  Granted, there are moments when you can lose the thread, but not many and never for long. And for readers south of the Provinces, some of the local color and Canadian references can take a few extra milliseconds to puzzle out. Still, my mouse hovered between a four and a five star rating only because of the weak copy-editing that left a dirty ring of typos around the tub. If you can ignore them, prepare yourself for a great read with a satisfying resolution.  --Larry Constantine, writing as Lior Samson, author of Bashert, The Dome, and Web Games"
5,I am using this with a 40 inch Samsung smart tv.  The extended bars were not needed.  This is very easy to mount to a wall stud with just two bolts.  Many bolts are provided to fit with your television.  It is very sturdy and able to be positioned in many different ways.  Highly recommended.
5,"I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability. My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store. Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues. I was refunded for all the items (Nook, cover case and screen protector) in no time at all. So, in summary, the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader, but B&N gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service!"
1,"Slow to load pages compared to all the other tablets in our household My main problem is B&N told me we could use gift cards to buy ebooks without adding a credit card to the account and that was very important since it was going to my youngest daughter and I didn't want her accidently buying books on credit. YOU CAN NOT BUY BOOKS WITHOUT ADDING A CREDIT CARD TO YOUR ACCOUNT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE B&N GIFT CARD CREDIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT. Online customer service told me the store would refund my gift card I went to the local store where I purchased the nook and gift card , they would not refund my gift card. So for $20 they get this negative review and lost a customer for life since they lied to me twice."
5,"First let me qualify my comments.  If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!  Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.  The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.  It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.  It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.  One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.  If you come across a word you are unfamiliar with you just touch it and up pops an option look it up.  I think Barnes and Noble has a winner here."
5,you can't beat the price and the installation was simple as can be. We installed it in our office and it is perfect! no problems and was completed in a matter of minutes
5,"Easy to install, with extra hardware for installing your TV. However, my TV had a curved back, so I used the included spacers to space the bars on the back of the TV. I was skeptical of the two lag bolts attaching the bracket to the stud under the drywall, so I added two 5/16"" lags, under washers holding the inside edges of the mounting brackets.  After installing the Swing Arm wall mount, I grabbed the end of the bracket, fully extended. The bracket didn't sag a bit. I concluded that the supplied two lag bolts would have been sufficient.  I've swung my TV out and exercised the various angles available, and found the swing arm not giving a millimeter.  I fully recommend this wall mount. I've a few other VideoSecu mounting brackets for wall mounted and floor stand speakers and one for an 80-inch Sharp TV. All are quality products."
5,"Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen. This did the job well, easy to install. I had to mount in a metal stud, so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly. Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors."
4,"Very sturdy. The arm is very stiff at first so you have to work it lose.  However, the mount works great, just make sure you get that stud just right. I was impressed with the quality and happy with the price."
2,"I am seriously wondering if I read the same books as everyone else.  I began reading with high hopes for two great thrillers based on other reviews, but I was sorely disappointed.  First of all, the sentence structure was choppy, with many sounding as of they were written by my eight year old.  Secondly, in an ill-conceived effort at humor, the protagonist comes off like a self-righteous jerk--and a sexist one at that.  Third, there were so many spelling and grammatical errors in the kindle edition (""accept"" instead of ""except""--twice, by the way...) that I wanted to take a red pen and edit the book myself!  Both books made for an interesting afternoon read, but the second book's big ""shocker"" I had pegged as soon as the character was introduced!  Overall, I was not impressed, but I will read the third book just to see where the story goes."
5,"I wanted a really long extendable wall mount for my 47 inch flat screen LED tv so that I could view it from my bed and this mount got the job done.  This is one of the longest extendable wall mounts I was able to find anywhere. I can extend this 180 degrees for a full viewing experience of my TV from my bed which is positioned parrall to the mount.  A sturdy, quality mount at a fair price!"
5,I used this to replace the charger my Nook HD+ came with. The original adapter made this annoying high pitched sound when plugged into a power source. This new one makes no noise and works just fine so I'm happy with it.
5,"This is a useful book for those new to Apple laptops but it also has handy hints for those who have used Macs for a long time but never took the time to learn many of the features. That brings up one of the strong points about Macs -- they are so easy to use that you don't need to spend much time educating yourself on how to use them. Consequently it is easy to be unfamiliar with useful shortcuts and tools and even some of the fun features.  I found the layout and colors to be pleasant and practical. The size of the book seems about right, covers are nice, and paper quality seems very good. The illustrations are clear and attractive although some of the screen shots are too small.  Overall, I found ""My Macbook"" to be superior to many computer handbooks in readability, content and appearance. Of course, it won't tell you everything you might possible need to know but it gives a comprehensive foundation and you can also find answers to more advanced questions on the Web."
5,"This is a great and simple eBook reader. It's light enough that I can hold it in one hand when reading, it's small enough that it's easy to take with me, the battery life is long enough that I forgot where I put the charger, and the screen lets me read for hours on end without eye strain. It does one thing and does it well. Get a tablet computer (I am partial to the Toshiba Thrive) if you want to play games, do email, browse the web, do video conferencing, etc."
2,"I bought this thinking it would be a great replacement for my worn power cable.  It charged my nook HD+ and my son's nook for a few weeks and then my son said it stopped working.  Sure enough, I did not even get 6 months of use out of it even though it was an original cable (it came in an OEM box).  I ended up borrowing my mom's charger and charging my Nook HD+.  I then wiped the device and will put the Nook app on a generic Samsung tablet.  My Nook HD+ still works, but given all of the new Android exploits, lack of third party chargers that can last as long as the original, and the fact Barnes and Noble no longer supports it I cannot see keeping it any longer when newer tablets are faster."
5,This is my 1st reader so I can't compare.  I like the sharpness of the letters.  It makes for easy reading.  In conjunction with calibre this is really easy to use.
5,"i got a 16gb microsd off of amazon for under $14.00 and it holds just little over 8k books, it was what swayed be over the kindle fire, that and the 1gb of ram vs 512mb. Now that they released a 8gb nook for $199.00 its price point is on par with the fire, and has the option of expansion, and  a simple hack allows for a custom android launcher, and i can easily install the amazon app store(and kindle app), android market place, and have a very decent wifi tablet, tbh i wasn't much of a analog book reader, but with this little nook tablet i've been averaging a book a week, along with .99-1.99 monthly magazine subscriptions.  when the original nook first came out i purchased one and took it back 2hrs later, it was less then what i expected, but i think barnes and noble has come a long way and now this version is very impressive.  battery life is decent, depending on your screen brightness preference and netflix usage, unless i am at home, i usually have the screen brightness at little less then half, and wifi off, and get about 6-9hrs of nonstop read time, 3 days of casual reading/standby."
5,This is one of my best purchases so far. It was easy to install and position. Makes watch TV in bed enjoyable. Now my wife can read while I watch TV without disturbing each other.
5,The VideoSecu line of articulating wall mounts has become our standard of choice for high quality articulating wall mounts within our home.  The value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our HDTVs conveniently to the wall.  Highly recommend this great quality product. This wall mount will secure any of the HDTVs using the VESA 100 or VESA 200 mount pattern. We like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the HDTV with a larger size there's a much better chance we won't need to replace the articulating mount.
5,"I could not be more pleased with - or impressed by - the Nook Tablet! I know that Amazon is ""enemy territory"", but the NT does a much better job of meeting my needs than would a Kindle Fire.  Not only can I use my NetFlix account but I also have full access to the Amazon Prime website to watch films and videos!  The screen is incredible - bright and colorful and very fast due to both the fast processor and the full Gig of RAM. I popped-in a 16G micro SDHC card and have more than enough room for my entire library of sideloaded epubs, pdfs, mp3s, and mp4 videos.  And, of course, the primary use: It's now much easier to read in bed at night. The backlit screen means no more glare from an external reading light."
5,"I must admit I was a skeptic regarding ebooks. I thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand. after purchasing 2 of these for my wife and I on a whim I have to admit, I love it.  Allows me to read books more quickly,not sure why, faster page turning, easier to find where you left off, maybe easier to read for longer periods of time, easier to carry with you anywhere maybe?.  Adjustable font size so you don't have to squint at small print, display is just like a real page, and you can flip pages with a swipe, a touch, or using the buttons on either side. I can't compare it to a Kindle because I never owned one, but my understanding is that it allows more formats than the kindle does.  so simple to transfer books from my computer, or purchase books via WIFI at B&N or at home, or even borrow from my local library online!  can't say enough great things about it, my wife and I were thrilled with them, not really any cons, wifi is difficult to connect in some places, thats pretty much it"
5,"My application was to set a 50"" TV right under the ceiling in my sports room. Plus, the location was above the closet's sliding doors leaving only 17"" of vertical space on the wall. This mount allowed for such a tiny foot print with no problems. And it carried another solution of aligning the top of the mount and the top of TV because of the ceiling proximity. I could orient upper brackets horizontally and use a steeper angle for lower brackets. Because of a plethora of holes in the arm plate I could accommodate for any geometry. Amazingly, this kit comes with brackets-extenders if you need for weird TV form factors. The construction is very sturdy and there is no gaps in the joints. The TV can be turned and moved to any direction without skewing or loss of horizontal. Because of the extended arm it has another great potential by attaching your great old speakers to the back of the TV holding brackets. This might save you $500 - $1,000 on a Sound Bar."
5,This book sucked me in from the very beginning.  My theory on what was going on changed several times during the reading.  I definitely recommend this book and I will be looking for other books by this author.
5,"I went from the Sony Reader Pocket Edition (which I really did like) to the Nook after the Wifi only version came out and I do not regret the move.  I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile - I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.  I like the fact that I can install my own new battery when the time comes and not have to send my reader off to have it done for me.  I like the fact that if there are any questions about the Nook, I just have to go to a nearby B&N and get the help I need instead of wasting time with emails only to receive vague answers from the techs.  All in all I think this is a wonderful device - exactly what I wanted.  I usually read about three to four books a week and being able to carry my whole library with me is great!  I would definitely recommend this product."
5,"Put this card in my Rezound and it works great. After formatting it I have around 59Gb of memory, more than I need for all my music and photographs. Makes my old 32Gb Zune obsolete. Shipping took about three days too."
5,This was easier that I thought to installed...even easier if you us a STUD finder to locate the beam where the you will need drill and attach the mount to the wall.  It came with many sets of screws to fit most TV systems.
5,"I am loving this product, it is what I was expecting and more.  I was worried about those extensions on the end and didn't even have to use them, but they are thicker than they look in the picture.  Was worried a bit about getting caught with you get what you pay for and a lot of cases that is true, but I think this will hold up as well as the ones you may spend $100's for.  I also like the range of movement that this has, which is a big reason for this particular model."
2,"The final story at the end was just lacking. The woman works so hard making everyone else's dreams come true and then her story was just flat. I really like the picture on the front cover, though."
5,"Ereaders have come a long way.  I tried the 4th Gen Nook with Glowlight, but like the 3rd Gen much better, it has the navigation bottoms, as well as the dark gray casing that make the text stand out.  I also think that the fonts are even better on the 3rd Gen as well.  It was worth the wait to have a great ereader at a great price.  Will be reading a ton of books on this device.  Happy Camper!"
5,"I am using this mount for a 39 inch Vizio TV and it has been great. The installation process was quick and easy and we LOVE the variety of angles that you can get from this mount. We have it on a side wall in our bedroom and we can pull the tv out and move it completely perpendicular to the wall on which it is mounted if we want to. (We don't usually move it quite perpendicular, but it works to do this.)  My only complaint is that the joints are a little on the stiff side. It takes quite a bit of force to move the TV from one position to another. It's a little hard for my wife to do-- especially with the TV mounted about 6ft up on the wall. It may be possible to loosen these pivot points, but I have not tried. I'm a little nervous about making it less stable if I do.  Overall, it's a great mount. Highly recommended."
5,"Mount 47"" TV with this. Moved and took it with me. Once in standard wall installation, the other time in a non-standard over window position. Easily adapted to both situations. Easy to reposition angle horizontally and vertically. Great value, I would recommend."
5,Ordered this product for a family memeber . Excellent service from Barnes and Noble on set up and operation. I would highly reocommend this product for anyone who likes to read
4,"If you are new to the Mac operating system or just not as familiar with it as you would like, this book is worth checking out.  The format of this book is non-threatening and friendly; if you can call a book that, in the way that it is not a big, boring book of foreign data.  The pages are designed with lots of color to keep your eyes interested.  So if you or someone you care about needs to unlock the power of the Macbook, the information is in here.  There are color screen shots of everything described in the book.  Sometimes when learning about the terminology, you will finally know what the initials stand for, like PPOE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet).  But it will not always set it up in a definition-like format, so you might have to pay close attention.  But that is probably just an exception.  There is no glossary of terminology, but there is a detailed index which should work the same for you.  Additionally, you will be able to learn a lot about your Macbook if you can get to the Apple Store and take one of their free intro to Mac classes offered at all stores.  I have taken it, and learned lots!"
5,"I read Ava Miles' other popular work, Nora Roberts Land, and was not disappointed by this later relation. The story starts very slow, and feels shallow for the first quarter, but it quickly evolves in a story that deals with serious issues. The characters and their problems are written about in a manner that allows you to actually care what happens beyond the simple male-female relationship aspect. I ended up reading two more of the books in the series, and am contemplating a fourth, even though they are not free. Definitely worth the time."
5,"The main character, Bridie, quickly becomes someone you know and can relate to.  She struggles to believe that the church teachings of her childhood still apply, even though her life has taken her far from the Christian values she grew up with.  At the same time, there's a family in another city that is falling apart... the mother has died, and the father is a pastor who feels disconnected from everyone and everything in his life.  It's easy to empathize with him, and yet see what others (his church leaders) are seeing from the outside, as well.  Overall, this was a great story and one that I enjoyed reading.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian fiction.  My copy of this book was provided by Bethany House in exchange for my honest review."
1,I bought this mount for our bedroom in order to swing and tilt the TV based on our viewing angle.  In order to move it I had to loosed the screws each and every time.  I had it connected to a 27in vizio LCD which is pretty light.  Could not find a tension to keep it where we wanted it.  Had to return
5,"Country Heaven is book 1 in the Dare River series by Ava Miles. I simply loved this book.  It is adventurous, has a mystery, loads of romance, and lots of family interaction and forgiveness. Rye Crenshaw has cut ties with his family, except for his little sister, Amelia Ann. Now his sister, Tammy, has come to him on his tour to ask him to come home as his Father, who had a heart attack, wants to talk to him.  Although he really sees no use, he heads home but takes his chef, Tory home with him.  He doesnt need her as a chef as much as a friend to help him get through with this visit.  He also doesnt want any publicity over this visit. When they arrive at Hollinswood, they find Ryes Mother has not relented one bit in her hostility towards Rye.  After all, he refused his place in the family law firm, and chose to embarrass them with his lifestyle.  Thankfully, he had changed his name from Hollins to Crenshaw, his grandfathers name. However, his Father is asking for reconciliation.  He shows Rye that he has all of Ryes CDs and tells Rye that he is very proud of him but ashamed of his own behavior towards Rye.  Ryes Mother lets them out after his talk with his Father.  He is to stay in the guesthouse.  Since this was where his grandfather stayed, Rye is not insulted as his Mother had intended. Rye is soon reconciled with his sisters, Tammy to a lesser extent than Ameila Ann.  However, Tammy is more like their Mother than Ameila Ann is.  Tammy is married to a stuffy lawyer and has two perfect children and a perfectly spotless house.  She has conformed to the perfect wife and mother that her own Mother did.  However, she does what is expected and greets Rye and Tory nicely.  Tory and Rye quickly see that Annabelle and Rory are not happy but are definitely perfect children.  Tammy and the kids soon come around, Annabelle more than the rest.  Rory is especially standoffish to everyone.  Amelia Ann asks Rye for help talking to her Father about going to Vanderbilt and becoming a lawyer. She does not want to follow in Tammys steps and be a society wife. Hamilton Hollins asks his son to run an errand for him.  While Rye is doing that, he sets out to visit Tory.  They get along great and are talking when Rye comes  home, his errand having been completed.  Tammy soon angrily follows.  She is angry at Rye for going to her husbands office and punching him.  When she turns to her Father for backup, she finds it was he who sent Rye to confront Sterling about his cheating on Tammy and sending a message that he is to stop now.  What they don't know is they have made Tammys situation much harder since Sterling also hits Tammy.  They adjourn to the main house for dinner and afterwards, Sterling appears having been invited by their Mother.  Hamilton tells Sterling he is not welcome here; but that they need to talk.  Tammy, Hamilton, Rye, and Sterling adjourn to the study.  Here, after being arrogant and saying some things about Tammy, Sterling says he will divorce Tammy for a million dollars.  Rye offers the money, Hamilton draws up the divorce papers as well as papers for complete custody of the children and Sterling who really didn't expect his price to be met, eagerly signs the papers.  Tammy is stunned but happy. When Rye returns to his tour, he and Tory continue their affair and plans are made for Tammy and her kids to move into Ryes home at Dare River.  Then the tabloids publish the terms of Tammys divorce and Ryes hand in it.  Tammy is horrified and Rye is angry and wants to know who talked.  Several hands point to Tory and Rye accuses her.  She claims her innocence and leaves for home as planned.  She is determined to finish her doctorial study.  This was the second time he accuses her of letting information about him slip and it will be the last time.  She won't be there to get any information. Who let the information out?  What will that do to Tammys divorce?  Will Amelia Ann be allowed to go to Vanderbilt or will Mothers plan for her win?  What does Torys leaving do to Rye and his career?  Will Rory come out of his shell? There is so much more going on in the lives of Rye, Tory, Tammy, Ameila Ann, and Ryes parents.  I loved how complicated the plot of this seemingly innocent romance became.  Ava Miles has a talent for complicating their lives yet still seeing the end.  Her use of language is spectacular.  Another good thing is that Country Heaven  is on Kindle Unlimited and its sequel in only $0.99.  I can hardly wait to start the next book.  It is on my Kindle and ready to go."
5,"At the recommendation of Marc Horne (whose new book I am about to jump into), I read Concrete Underground by Moxie Mezcal. It's a fast-paced gritty novel, with a very violent bent. I've been enjoying indie fiction lately, and this did not disappoint.  The books is definitely interesting and well written. Think Palahniuk meets film noir with a new-age punk-emo vibe.  As it turns out, I eventually got thrown off the ride that Marc describes as a ""... noir plot [that] loops it into a feedback cycle until it breaks."" Still struggling with the end though (not sure what ended up happening, if anything at all). I don't hold that against the author though.  Lots of fun and very layered. Give it a shot."
5,"We have a 26"" TV in our bedroom and no real table-top space for it, so we mounted it above our dresser with this.  The arm tilts and moves smoothly so it's easy to set this however we want, as often as we like.  Great purchase."
1,"My screen stopped working a week out of warranty.  Apparently, this is a common issue with the Nook Simple Touch.  Customer service told me that Barnes & Noble is aware of this issue but they do not plan to repair or replace anything.  This is not the way to treat customers.  I am canceling all my pre-orders and I will try a different ereader."
5,"So after reading numerous upon numerous reviews about kindle vs nook....I took the dive and got the Nook...I could not be happier. After reading all the reviews, pretty much all of them talked about sluggish performance...sluggish performance that no longer exists with the new 1.4 update. That is pretty much the selling point right there. B&N can constantly fix all of it's bugs through a simple software update. Is it perfect? No. At least now my pages turn quickly, there's an internet browser, I can always connect to the bookstore via 3G or wifi, I can use the buttons to turn pages or simply just swipe the screen to turn, there is also a nice cover flow to help search through books. Anyway...overall I am happy. Can I sit here and say it's better than the Kindle? No...for I have not tried the Kindle. I do suggest that if you're curious about the whole e-reader craze of late, just head into a B&N and take a look for yourself. If you don't like it, don't buy it...if you buy and decide it's not for you, then just return it since there are no restocking fees...and if you end up buying and keeping it, there's also that piece of mind that if anything does happen to your Nook, all you have to do is take it to your local B&N and have them take a look at it for you...  *A BONUS: If you take your Nook to a B&N and show them what ebook you're reading, you get a free cup of coffee...not sure how long this will last but hey, free coffee is free coffee :)"
4,"First Sentence:  Neither of the two men trusted the other, but that, after all, was the nature of the business.  NYPD Detective Clay Ryder is the force's art expert.  When the Metropolitan Museum of Art receives a long-lost Van Gogh via UPS from Argentina, its Ryder's case to find out where it came from and to whom it belongs.  Israel's Mossad wants Ryder to help them find the SS officer they believe sold the painting from Paris during the war.  The rightful heir, Rachael Meredith, officially unveils the painting to the Met and finds herself besieged with people wanting the painting.  Things turn violent when Rachael refuses to part with the painting.  The action was good, the characters of Clay and Rachael were interesting and I always like learning something when I read.  In this case it was the looting of art by the Nazis.  But then, the story changed tacks and became more about Rachael, art dealers and auction houses.  While that was also interesting, it felt as though there were one too many story lines for me.  It was exciting and suspenseful, but could have used a bit more focus.  This was not a ""wow"" read, but it was a really good summer or airplane read. (EBMRG Selection)"
5,"This was perfect for my 24"" LED monitor, I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems.  It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6' HDMI cable which I was not expecting."
5,this holds up my 55inch sony with ease. make sure u mount this with ur own lag screws into the heart of the 2x4 ur mounting to and u won't have any problem--u may have to make a modificatoin or two but use ur brain and figure it out-- it'll be there till the house falls!!!3inch lag screws is the way to go don't be cheap go buy em.---how much did u pay for the tv????
5,"I already know probably more than most about OS X, but this book does a phenomenal job of writing about many different topics in an uncluttered, and aesthetically pleasing way.  It's a very Apple-like publication with very high use value to all but the most die-hard Mac users.  It makes a great present to somebody who switched to Macs, too."
5,"I tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble.com, but they never posted it. Oh well.  The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.  The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.  The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs. Once you do that, you will be able to highlight and take notes like you can with the actual books.  If you want a simple e-reader, the Nook Simple Touch is the best. (FYI: It's costs less on the B&N website.)"
5,"This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)"
5,"was awesome untill it caught on fire,... probably cuz the raspberry pi caught on fire, .. there was a lot on fire.. always check the power supply before connecting devices,,.on a side note, raspberry pis will NOT handle 120v AC at either the input or USB.. trust me"
5,"Started out with a Nook Simple Touch, but my eyes aren't what they used to be so I gave that to my wife & got the Simple Touch with Glowlight 4 months ago.  I am 98% happy with it- it loses a point for occasionally going back to the screensaver when I press the Glowlight button, and one point for occasional ghosting in extremely bright sunlight.  Both complaints are trivial, as the Nook's good points far outweigh the bad. The Glowlight is awesome!  Clean, even lighting across the screen and it's easily adjustable.  The lookup function for word definitions is very handy, battery life is phenomenal, memory/storage is generous, and it's very easy to navigate the B&N website for new books.  I guess some folks have had issues with the screen cracking and such, but I've banged mine around quite a bit and never had any problems.  Overall I've been very impressed with my Nook and highly recommend it to someone looking for a simple, easy to use e-reader."
5,"This was purchased to take the place of a 32gb card that was about full.  The phone was only supposed to support a max of 32gb according to the documentation, but if you format the card in the phone first, it will see the whole card.  Even though the phone cant use the XC part, I still see no evidence of lag or performance issues.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to upgrade a 32gb card in an Android phone."
5,"What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism. The story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it!"
1,"Mounting a 42 inch LG TV weighing 33 pounds PRO Less expensive Previous purchase of VideoSecu product Appeared solid and strong Had tilt and various adjustments Mount on single stud CON Sagging..this is amazing that it sags and does so at different angles based on how far the TV is pulled out from the wall   Therefore one cannot keep the TV properly aligned because any movement changes the tilt or other angles. Mounting is a pain because the mounting bracket never comes apart from the articulation arm Critical bolt attachment for the mount from the TV to the articulation arm does not get tight!  This is amazing. It is not stripped but it does will not stay tight even from the first use.  This makes the product unsafe.    I am amazingly frustrated bordering on angry because of the time put into this and now holes in the wall.  I need to get a different one.  My prior experience was with a VideoSecu MW380B TV wall articulating mount, which is far superior for a larger TV.  I bought this other one because I wanted a tight fit to the wall.   Can I send a bill for my time and work putting it up and taking it down?????"
1,"Purchased this adapter a few months ago, I noticed a flicker after 1 month but now it does not work at all. A wise person said ""Cheap thing no good...good thing no cheap"""
5,"My students and I used to huddle around laptops to discuss projects. Now I have a 47"" TV for display and this mount makes it possible to put it on any wall and swivel it in any direction depending on how many people need to see the screen. Really stable, no wiggling"
5,"I cannot believe the seller who sold me this not good, great Nook HD+, that is keeping me very happy. I have been truly blessed, this Nook tablet is the best. I am watching movies on it via Hulu and Netflix and other apps for movies etc. The video and audio are great for me either outside on my porch or indoors. I do not plan to do much more other than playing a game here and there, this tablet is sufficient to my needs. There is no camera, if you need one get another type of tablet. I recommend for those who do not need a super tablet, however, this tablet can do a lot. I just have not tried it all yet. I will  again say this, the video playback to me is awesome,it is truly HD. I am very satisfied with my refurbished Nook HD+, II am getting a lot for very little. I recommend buying thNook for a few dollars worth a  lot of fun."
5,"looks like now dream became true - all my files stored on my phone and right with me as I need them :) thanx to San Disk for a good product. Only thing - when I just got the card first time I copyed files on it at my laptop and after when I put it in to my Samsung Galaxy S2 ... it was not seen by the phone... solution was simple - it needs to format by the phone and after just hook it via USB and transfer files one more time, so now it works good ;)"
4,"this is a great idea. I know that virtually nothing computer-related comes with an instruction manual, and yes, you can just turn on your Macbook and it'll work, but there's so much you miss out on.  This is highly recommended for newbies to the Mac platform. I've owned a Macbook for years, and I always upgrade to a newer Macbook, but even I learned a few tips from this book I didn't know!  The average Mac user might want to take a look at this book at the library or from a friend; if you know anyone new to the Mac world, it'd be one of a few books they absolutely should get as a gift."
5,I wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it. This does that well.  I don't move it often it seems strong and well built. If you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an Allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot. The articulation is sketchy. For my uses and the cheap price this was perfect.
5,"This is a great wall mount.  I have installed three others and I like this the best.  It extends enough with the second arm so that you can mount a large TV so that it fits in the corner of a room.  The TV will hide the actual wall mount and arms mounting to the back of the TV.  This one was installed thru a plaster drywall into cinder block wall.  I used  the 2 wall anchors and bolts provided in the mounting accessory pack.  The 42"" TV bolt pattern fit the mounting plate so I did not have to use the adjustable arms provided in the package.  Total installation time was less than 20 minutes.  I like the fact that you can tilt it, rotate it (makes it easy to get the TV level)  and move it in and out a great distance and it will go back pretty flush to the wall.  The instructions are easy to follow.  Overall, I think this is a sturdy mount that will confidently hold a large screen TV and it does not look like a massive mount like some do."
4,"Used this for a Panasonic 32"" LCD TV.  Mount works fine, instructions were minimal.  I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall.  I did have a problem hanging the TV, per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV, this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount, mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount, this was a lot easier."
5,"I needed a television hanger with good extension. This did the job. I installed this in a closable TV cabinet that requires me to push the TV in and pull it out routinely. By loosing the nuts on the swinging parts a little, it now moves with very little effort. But the nuts are the kind that will hold their position, even when they are loosened so no worries of things coming apart. I have a 43 inch TV that it worked just fine on. Glad I bought this."
5,"Bought this for my Raspberry Pi. No issues with filesystem corruption in a device that can and will be disconnected from power abruptly, but I have a system image prepared just in case."
5,"Brand name adapter this is just like the one you got when you bought your nook,. I would always recommend using a designated adapter. The charging cable is a whole different story but the adapter defiantly use the designated charger."
5,"I bought this for my Raspberry Pi 3 and it does work. So if you are wondering about compatibility, it is compatible. Nice to finally have 64 gigs of storage."
5,"I must admit, I'm very cautious of what I buy especially when I've seen this identical bracket in the electronic stores priced three to four times than this one.  Bracket arrived much faster then what Amazon estimated and was well packaged.  The directions were adequate but I'm very mechanically inclined so used them as a quick guide and had this bracket installed with my Sony 37"" LCD in under a half hour.  My hats off to the marketing folks with this manufacturer as they did their homework and included additional hardware and brackets to meet any possible configuration out there.  Including mounting tools and level were also an exceptional idea.  And tossing in a 7' HDMI cable was the icing on the cake."
5,"This is not a high cost unit so i didn't expect too much.  It worked well and has given good service now for two years.  It could have a better cable management system on it, but I don't expect such frills at this price.  This is solidly made, no complaints"
5,I have had my Nook for a week now and just love it.  I find the touchscreen easy to understand and use.  I have downloaded books from the local public library using OverDrive and Adobe Digital Edition and all have come through perfectly.  Downloading books from B & N have been quick and efficient.  I like being able to Find/Search forward and backward and to be able to look up words easily.  I have used bookmarks and highlights as well.  I also like the feature of being able to go to Last Read Page or to quickly pick a page using the Go To.  I have downloaded my own wallpaper and screen savers.  The two reasons I chose the Nook over the Kindle:  local support at Barnes and Noble and the ability to borrow ebooks from the public library.  I also easily added my own MicroSD card and added personal PDF documents to it. I love reading on it!!!
5,Great book. I loved the story and flow of the story. I read the whole series and enjoyed the books very much. Characters are interesting and blend together great. I would highly recommend books
3,"I can't give it more than 3 stars because it feels like it is : Cheap. Nobody mentioned the capacity but I could only store 30 6X4 pictures. I found ridiculous when people complain it is not leather, what can you expect for 8 bucks ?"
5,This is my first Tv wall mount and I couldn't ask for any thing better. You can watch your Tv from any direction. Comes all different types of screws to hold your Tv to the mount. Also comes with2.5 inch long bolts to hold mount on the wall.
5,"I bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house. I love all three of them. All mounts have different tv's on them, One is a 50"", 40"" and a 32"". Product comes with multiple screw for different tvs. Outstanding product for the price. All tv's have been mount for a little over a year. This product is a full motion mount for $29.99!! and it is Prime!"
5,Rye and Tory's story hilights an out of control country western star and a wholesome mid western girl's discovery of each other and then falling in love. Along with that theme goes the lesson of forgiveness. Rye is estranged from his wealthy southern family. Due to his father's sudden illness the family is forced to partially reconcile. His over baring mother controls the family. A good story about love for family and friends.
5,"I was lucky that I didn't need the extensions, the holes in the square plate the extensions bolt to matched up with the TV mounting holes perfectly.  That saved some installation time.  It is a very sturdy bracket."
1,"Boy do I feel burned with this SanDisk 64gb MicroSDXC card. Product 'worked' in my Motorola Photon 4G phone for about 6 weeks but then failed in the strangest way. The card has been loaded with roughly 47gb of data, some very personal, and it is now in a permanent READ ONLY mode. I can access what's on the card; read it, play it etc. but can no longer delete, erase, format or otherwise to anything to change the contents. This I have tried to do while memory card is in the phone or in a thumb drive adapter attached to my PC. All fails. So I am really stuck when it comes to warranty. If I want to submit for a replacement I'll have to send in the old card but since I cannot erase anything I would have to send it back with some pretty sensitive information...  I guess I've learned the hard way not to keep things like passwords on phone memory.  Sorry this is not a full review and perhaps this is a unique hardware failure but if it happens to one person surely it will happen again.  6 weeks is a terrible product lifetime."
5,"LOVED THIS BOOK!  I had country music playing softly in the background while I devoured each and every page of ""Country Heaven"" by Ava Miles.  This was a contemporary romance with characters that you couldn't help but love.  Country singer, Rye Crenshaw, sneaks away to enjoy some comforting diner food, but ends up being comforted by the cook.  Not at first!  She was not into country music or country cowboys.  And he was not into petite, intelligent women.  Let me tell you... there were lots of tingles in this book!  The romance grew and developed, and then it crashed and burned, and came back again full force.  THIS is what romance is all about!  This book was more than just a romance novel.  It delved into family.  Neither Tory nor Rye had family to start with.  Tory's family had all died and Rye had chosen to leave his family.  When the time came to make amends and rebuild the kinship, Tory helped Rye see what was truly important.  If you want a Happily-Ever-After that will have you yanking tissues out of the box, one right after the next, I heartily recommend this book to you.  I am definitely going to look for more books by this author.  Her writing flowed with characters that will stay in your heart long after you read the last page.  This one positively deserves 5 stars!"
4,I read this probably 50 years ago in my youth and I just re-read it for the first time.  It was a fun read but not as good as my memory of it.  Barry
5,"I have a Nook HD+.  As they are no longer produced I wanted to make sure I got an extra original charger and cable.  Glad I did as some OEM supplied cables, like this, just can't be replicated.  The quality of cable, especially Nook connector, are perfect."
5,"It was hard to find a reasonably priced tablet and reader with these specs.  Everything was original as described and has worked without a problem since purchase.  I am pleased with the price, quality of viewing and speed of this device."
5,I have my 32 inch Tv on the wall and it works great. Easy to install and came with all the parts. The screws that it comes with for the TV will not fit but you can buy some for 2 dollars.
5,wasn't expecting to get this to work at the full amount of memory as the HTC sensation did not say that it would. But it did and I AM VERY HAPPY
1,"I got this as a  birthday gift from my kids. I was really excited to get a reader but because of some diabetic retinopathy I couldn't read it well. I need something with a backlight. I tried to take it back to Barnes and Noble to purchase a more expensive one that I could use but as always they were not willing to help me. They are the worst at customer service I have ever seen. I won't buy anything from them ever again. They are just unwilling to help. They always have a very lame excuse. I've asked my kids not to buy anything for me from them every again. I sure won't. This NOOK is of no use to me at all, it's not easy to use or easy to read and I just wanted to trade it in, pay more for something I could use but they said sense I had opened the package and tried to use it that I could not return it. Now I have a NOOK that is of know value at all to me and a store that is unwilling to help me in any way even though I had a receipt and an unused product. I will buy product from Amazon because they are so good to support their customers but I won't buy any product that is a Barnes and Noble. product at all."
5,"I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and this is the trick for my needs. Great price, works perfect, shipped extremely fast, and works extremely fast in my camera, I have 32 Gig used and have another one in my pocket as a standby.  Awesome storage for the Samsung phone....that's my application, voice, image and video storage..and it works like a high speed champ!!  I would buy again and again."
5,I have bought two of these videos ecru tv mounts and both have worked great. I used one for 42 inch and one for 32 inch. I like the tilt because one is up high and like pulling it in and out to move towards different directions. It feels secure and holds the tv well. One of mine is even a older flat screen and more heavy than newer ones.
5,"I purchased this plug to see if it would work with the Mediabridge Brand USB to Micro USB card that I had purchased, because after getting the cable, my tablet wouldn't charge plugged into just any outlet.  I have a NOOK Color, and that plug worked to charge the tablet.  So I saw this one (at the largest Mass Merchandising store) for half the price here at Amazon and purchased it to try.  And it works.  Charges my Toshiba Excite perfectly through the micro USB port.  Now I can leave my original plug and cable at home and use this Nook Plug and Mediabridge Cable at work.  Perfect!  No more cords in my purse. The Mediabridge cable I purchased:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mediabridge-High-Speed-USB-2-0-Coiled-A-Male-to-Micro-B-Cable/dp/B008DVMRXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mediabridge High Speed USB 2.0 - (Coiled) - A-Male to Micro-B Cable</a> For under $20 I have an extra cable and plug to charge my Toshiba Excite."
4,"Very simple set up and ease of installation. I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top hex-screw of one of the center connections (thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the TV)so that I could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the TV as separate processes. Both simple and quite easy. Then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and re-installing the hex-screw. I was able to install a 32"" RCA TV, without any help in less than 20 minutes.  Manufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware, as well as a hex wrench, a small open wrench and a level."
5,"I got my Nook Wi-Fi/3G about 2 months ago, and I love it!  I researched ALOT of ereaders before making the decision to buy the Nook; in fact, I originally bought a Kindle from a local store, but never took it out of the box, and returned it to purchase the Nook.  I originally decided to go with the 3G for two reasons; 1) I wasn't sure I could set up my home wi-fi to work with the Nook, and 2) I wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere.  And I've been glad I chose that; I have yet to purchase a book over just the wi-fi.  I was at a doctors office recently, waiting and waiting and waiting, and it was wonderful to be able to shop, buy a book, and start it while enduring the endless waiting.  The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great, all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook.  Also, the store nearest me has ""classes"" on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners, and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.  Speaking of the physical store, I also like that I can read any book for FREE for up to an hour a day in the store.  That gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a ""free sample"" and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not.  I've looked at the newest generation Nook, which has just recently become available, and I'm glad I got my Nook when I did; I like it so much better than ANY ereader I've looked at.  I can drop my nook in my purse, and anytime I'm stuck somewhere and want to read, I've got a whole library right there with me.  The Nook is awesome!!!"
5,"First the LG G3 is an amazing phone.  This is why I took the next step and bought this adapter.  Connected phone to 55"" HDTV, turned phone sideways, and was watching high def streaming TV via phone apps in full HD resolution (e.g. no black bars on top/bottom).  One thing to note about the packaging.  On Amazon it says for LG G3, but when I received it the box does not explicitly state support for LG G3.  My assumption is LG uses the same connection setup as prior LG phones - thank goodness LG stayed with their standard connection port."
5,This is a great charging cable for the Nook.  It is way better than the one that came with the original Nook Color.  The only downside is you cannot use it on the computer to add books to your Nook.  This was not an issue for me because I have other cables for that.
5,"After spending several weeks barely reading at all based on a constricting financial budget and then the onset of a new job, I eased myself back into going through my book review stack with the volume Not a Sparrow Falls by Linda Nichols.  Not a Sparrow Falls could not have been a better choice.  It is the type of book that reminds a person why they started reading Christian fiction books to begin with.  Linda Nichols touched on a variety of topics highly relevant in today's society including meth addiction, child abuse, and depression.  Her story follows a young woman who flees her own personally bad situation and ends up in a small town where she shortly ends up employed as a nanny at a local parsonage where the pastor is not only the leader of a church but a high-profile Christian in many media outlets.  Everyone in this story needs help in some form or another, and even ""Christians"" are having trouble appreciating their faith anymore.  There is a lot to digest but the book is never without hope.  I think you will love ""Bridie"" from the get go as I did and will spend the whole book hoping for the best for her.  I received a review copy of this book from Bethany House to facilitate my review."
5,Works Great. Holds my 40 inch TV effortlessly. Very well built. Definitely worth the price. Easy to install TV to the mount. Has cord clips. TV can be tilted up or down and sideways. Extends from the wall 24 inches. I highly recommend this brand..
5,"This is possibly one of the best mounting kits I've ever purchased. I like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of TV. (Whether they have a rounded or flat back). Mine had a flat back so I didn't need the extra piece, but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall.  The adjustable arm is nice, as it is setup in our bedroom. At night the TV is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall, and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk - also making the ability to view the TV while working.  The material is very strong, hubby did a pull up on the bar and it didn't even budge.  This thing seems as though it will last quite a long time.  It's already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom, I'll be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model TVs."
5,"I was hesitant because of the price but after looking at the reviews I decided to go ahead and purchase one. This is the first time I mounted a TV on the wall so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I put a 32"" Toshiba LCD on it. Mount is strudy and has good adjustments. Installed it in about 20 minutes. Works great and I would definately recommend this for a low cost alternative for mounting a tv."
4,"It is a great stand for the price and works great. The problem for me it don't fit my 25"" Samsung TV with  a 3 inch square mounting holes.  The hole pattern on the stand doesn't accommodate that small  of a pattern.  You will need to do some re-drilling of the stand bracket or get a plate that can be bolted on to the existing mounting to accommodate the smaller hole pattern. Other than that it is a great"
5,"MORE UPDATES at the bottom of my review!  My review includes details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.  I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got ""overdrive"", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook: - Nook(N) by barnes & noble - Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com - Sony Reader Touch(ST) 1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.  N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats. K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library? ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.  2. PRICE!  N: 149 with wifi ST: 169 NO WIFI K: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)  While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.  *You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new ""lend me"" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.  *The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.  *You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!  *Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.  * all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.  *The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.  *Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.  *The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.  *And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.  *In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.  On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to ""swipe"" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.  Update Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:""dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.  Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature."
5,It is a nice small photo album. It was purchased as gift. It went over well. I liked ot over all look and the colors were spot on. The interior is a brown cardboard color. A niec small photo album.
2,"My brother is a trucker and pre-ordered this.  He was out on the road when it arrived, so he asked me to charge it, update it, and play with it.  FUN!  I am not a trucker, but from what I hear from my brother, the tools on this device are awesome.  It looks like it would be very helpful for him.  The thing is huge, a 7"" screen!  Overall, this seems to be a great tool.  My problem with it is that it cannot update.  I have a brand new computer running Windows 7 64 bit.  It's a Dell Studio XPS 8100 (i5 processor).  After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into ""connected"" mode when it's plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (""Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)"").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.  I am hoping that it will update on my brother's XP laptop. we'll see when he gets back home."
5,"I love the remote, my old remote was going bad and I looked everywhere trying to find something, finally I decided to look online and I found the exact same kind, and they work great with my tv, I got one for my parents also. Great remote."
5,"This was installed by two handy men - the first they had every done.  Went very well.  This mount was chosen because of the 20  inch extension.  The wall is recessed so the TV needs to come out of that hole.  The mounting plate sets above the 23"" LED TV an inch but the length of the extension makes that O.K.  I would have done this myself (68 yo female) except the handy stud finder declared the whole 3' wall was a stud!!  With much chatting the handy men were finished in 45 minutes."
5,"Bought this mount for a 32inch Panasonic LED TV. The mount may look cheap, but I found it to be extremely sturdy and a great buy for the price. I strongly recommend it to everyone."
5,My husband was so impressed with the cover that he would like for Marie to do his cover on his upcoming book and he is doing it through Kindle and Createspace.
5,"Good product. Used on a 24"" TV. Had a little issue with the length of the screws that came with, but I had other washers to use so it worked out ok. Seems nice and sturdy once I got it mounted on the wall."
5,"These books are not ""great literature"" (sorry Stephen Leather), but they are great fun.  However, they are well written, the characters interesting and the plotline compelling.  You will fall in love with the main character, Jack Nightingale.  I found myself wanting to know what would happen next in each subsequent book in the series.  The book is a bit bloody in parts, so if you are squeamish this might not be the novel for you.  The book and subject matter is dark but I do enjoy a twisty tale of murder and mayhem.  I have read the rest of the series and would recommend reading the books in order."
5,"Format the card in the device (look up how to format on your individual device) and voila - 64GB of whole grain silicon goodness.  The read speed is great.  The write speed is a tad slower than my 32GB card, but not enough to knock off points.  YMMV, but most Android devices made in the last year or two, using 4.0 or higher (Ice Cream Sandwich), shouldn't have any problems."
5,"I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.  I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.  Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.  I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.  My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).  Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.  It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.  It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.  As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it."
5,"Wow, I really enjoyed this book. Good characters, I didn't figure out the ending until, well, the ending. Can't wait for the next book.  As usual for digital books, spell check doesn't count as an editor. Yeah, is spelled Yeah, not Yea. I know it's petty, but that word appeared about 5 times, always spelled wrong.  But, for the price, I have no complaints."
3,"Purchased for my mother since she lost her original charger.  She wanted another OEM adapter, so I was glad to find one even if equally serviceable usb adapters can be had for cheaper.  Works fine, just overpriced."
5,I purchased this mount based on others comments beforehand and i appreciate the guidance. The problem with wall mounting flat screen TV's is to make sure the hole pattern of the mount lines up with the hole pattern on the TV you buy. I'm using this mount with a VIZIO E320ME 32-inch and it works perfect.
4,"Only gave this four stars because it's only supporting a 32"" TV. I think I would be scared to mount a 55"" TV on it. If you sprang for a 50"" or bigger TV, spend a little more on a properly rated mount. As with any TV mount, make sure you're hitting wall studs with the main screws, don't just use anchors in drywall or you're asking for trouble. LOTS of hardware included in the kit, so mounting any style or brand of TV shouldn't be a problem."
5,"Came on time, fair price, and comparatively easy to set up. TWC took the old one and would not return it, and their ""replacement"" clicker is useless. This works fine!"
5,Clearly written book explains Chromebook procedures in easy to follow chapters.  I bought this Chromebook for my sister-she is challenged by new technoilogy!  She had it working the first day!  I was so impressed-bought another for myself!
5,"I have really enjoyed this book, and purchased the rest of the series and read them all over one weekend. I found the characters well developed.  A family suffering from terrible disfunction but able to start to find their way out and learning to care, really care for one another.  So far the series is about self discovery in who they are, what are their passions, and how to be happy.  I am excited for more to follow."
5,"Excellent. Gives me 59.4gbs of extra storage in my Microsoft Surface. Absolutely love it. It's a little bit slow, but doesn't bug me at all. Just takes a while for it to read everything. Not a problem."
5,"This was exactly what I was looking for, a economical way to mount a 32 inch tv in our bedroom high on wall under tray ceiling.  It is heavy and I had a little trouble marking the holes to drill.  My mistake was not following advice to plum both holes, so after I bolted to wall it looked plum but after I mounted tv to bracket it was slightly off balance, not a big dealto correct except 6 toggle bolts are very hard to screw in with socket.  Overall, I am very happy with this, a lot of options to move tv.  HDMI cable big bonus.  Looks great too, esp with cover.  The only negative was to tilt it up or down you need to loosen 3 bolts and the supplied hex wrench too big to adjust one of the bolts so I actually had to purchase new wrench since I did not have any and adjustable wrench will not fit inside very small space for adjustment.  It takes two people to properly install this and tv.  I recommend this if you have a 32 inch Dynex."
5,This item works perfectly for what I need it to do. It allows me to connect a Bluetooth mouse to my galaxy tab 4 as well as my external hard drive without any problems.  I would recommend this product for any micro usb to usb connections
5,"I read the first two books a while ago, and then decided to pick up Predators of Darkness again after seeing how many people loved it like I did and the  fact that I hadn't read the third book yet.  I can say that it is just as good the second time around.  Even knowing what happened and who the clones were, I was captivated, still reading with new/old eyes in to the nuances of the characters and subtle shifts that were telltale signs I didn't see the first time around.  The plot is your basic survival/end of the world story line.  We have a community of people, there are power struggles and physical struggles, but the survivors seem to have a hierarchy system in place that actually works.  This is where we meeting our hero Daniel, while not the `leader', or even the one who herded the survivors into the fallout shelter to begin with, he's a leader all his own. He and his best friend Lucas are the main ones who go out looking for caches of supplies and food.  This is where the story twists.  While the plot line is about the politics and struggle of daily life for survivors, it's also about their main enemies, the Shifters.  These are genetically mutated beings who, as far as Daniel can tell, mutating even more... not good for the survivors. I'm not going to give away any more of the story.  And there is so much more. Not all shifters are evil, people aren't who they seem, and the good Doctor has a hunch of why the world has collapsed.  You need to read it for yourselves; it's a great end of the world sci-fi novel that leaves a lot more of the plot line open for future books.  In fact there are two more; in addition I was just informed that the writer is currently finishing up the screen play. While some readers claim it starts off slow... well it does a little... I think it's necessary in order to introduce the readers into the world the way Hilley wants them to be. The next two books are Beyond the Darkness and The Game of Pawns, each fantastic and more disturbing. Enjoy!"
5,Could not put this down wanting to find out what was going to happen and who was behind the whole thing. Very interesting and can't wait to read book two in the series.
5,"I read every Perry mason book voraciously. Finding the Lam/Cool mysteries, and getting to enjoy more of Gardner's characters, is like Christmas morning as a kid. Each book is a gift!"
5,I bought this for my Droid Bionic to up my storage capabilities. It has worked flawlessly. It is quick; no lag in reading or writing. It was shipped quickly and arrived exactly as advertised.
5,"I bought this for a 22"" TV for my son. I mounted this onto the corner stud and it works great! I love the angles it can achieve. Fees Very sturdy and well built. It works perfect for my application. Very happy with this purchase!"
5,"had a couple of guys put this up for me, but they said it was easy to install. I like the fact that I can move it around easily and tilt it anyway I want it to be."
5,"I needed this iClicker for a college class and it works just like its suppose to. I've used it for a couple different classes now too and I haven't had any problems with it at all. After a year I've only had to change the batteries once since the batteries it comes with are a cheap off-brand set,  of course. There's a newer version of the iClicker that has a little screen on it but they both do the same exact thing, so if you're trying to save some money you'll be fine with just going with this one. Its only a few dollars cheaper than the same version found on the iClicker website but I also got free shipping so I figured to just get it from Amazon. Don't worry about it being fake or a knockoff, its a genuine iClicker product, and you just have to register it on the website to begin using it."
5,"I just wanted this for my Samsung Galaxy S5.  Works fine.  If you're like me and didn't care to research speed vs price vs cost per GB, just get it."
5,"This mount is sturdy, easy to install, and easy to mount the TV to.  The included hardware was heavy duty also.  The action is good, and tension is adjustable.  The tilt can be adjusted by using the knob in lieu of one of the bolts, or locked in place (which makes it more difficult for someone to remove the TV unless they have a wrench with).  I mounted the 27"" TV on our lanai, so a little theft-proofing is a good thing.  The TV is now visible either on the lanai, or from the patio.  I RECENTLY BOUGHT A SECOND ONE, AND THEY HAVE CHANGED.  STILL STURDY, BUT LACKING THE QUICK MOUNT FEATURE! NOW YOU MUST HOLD THE TV IN PLACE WHILE INSERTING THE TINY SCREWS THROUGH THE BACK."
5,"When I first heard about e-book readers, I was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books. (I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me. The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still! Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!! I was SOOOOO excited!! Now, if only I had NOT wasted $5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover, that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook... :("
5,"This one is the real deal for the Nexus 5.  Works perfectly and picture quality is amazing.  It should work perfectly for your device as long as you have slimport (Nexus 4/5/6, LG G2/G3, Nexus 7 2013, others) and use a good quality HDMI 1.4 cable.  To my knowledge, Samsung phones DO NOT support slimport.  If your phone supports slimport, you are much better off buying this adapter compared to MHL adapters which require power input.  I was looking to buy a HTPC or setup a small itx box for running XBMC/TVMC/Kodi on my non-smart Plasma TV, but realized I had a Nexus 5 with a broken screen that was still functional.  Instead of spending a lot of money on an HTPC box, I decided to try out this slimport adapter with my Nexus phone paired with the TVMC Kodi app to stream movies.  I'm happy to say I've found the perfect solution for my needs.  I previously tried using a chromecast for mirroring my Nexus phone, but the input lag and reduction in quality didn't cut it.  Audio was a little off sync with chromecast also.  I haven't noticed any input lag, display problems or artifacts with this slimport adapter at all. Audio over hdmi works through the slimport adapter just fine.  There are many generic style and older slimport adapters for sale on amazon that are problematic, but after reading the reviews of this particular one and using it myself, I can vouch for it.  One little tip I'd like to add if you plan to use this slimport adapter with a smartphone for TVMC/Kodi is to download the Yatse remote app.  You can use your OTHER phone as a remote over wifi to control the device attached to the slimport adapter.  Perfect!"
4,"Crows Can't Count, A.A. Fair  Mr. Harry Sharples came to the Cool & Lam Agency; he was a co-trustee for a trust fund that will terminate when the youngest beneficiary turns 25. One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn't but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).  Lam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).  Lam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and ""the delightful Senora Cool"" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia."
5,"This memory device comes formatted with extFAT Formating, but you can reformat it to NTFS if need be. the 30 MB/s speed is not terribly fast, but for the price it will do."
5,"This Micro Sd Card is fantastic. I had some fears that it would not work in my Samsung Galaxy II or my Motorolla Xoom Tablet. I ordered 2 cards and the work in both after a format from each respectively, both ssaid that they maxed out at 32 gig cards. I averaged 59.5 gigs of information after the format. I travel frequently and don't always have the opportunity to stream from a cloud so these cards fit perfectly for the time where I cant get a signal on an airplane or a hotel where I cant get a signal either. I use them for Mp3's, photos or video or whatever other storage that I need for documents."
5,"LOVED this series!  This is why I love the Kindle Unlimited.  I find these new authors that I never would have purchased otherwise and find that I love them!  It's awesome because if it's dull, I haven't lost anything.  But you can be sure that I'll be buying anything else in this series, which I hope never ends!  I read this entire series in about a week.  So interesting, creepy, mysterious, and well written!  As an American, I did have trouble with some of the British words, but it wasn't nearly as bad as some other authors I've read.  The Kindle was helpful probably 70% of the time in figuring out what the words meant."
4,I received the proper item. not the one pictured here. it fit almost perfect. minor adjustment. works as stated. I am completely happy with this purchase. rated 4 star because of minor adjustment. would recommend to a friend/.price was very low. compared to other stores.  pat. 2378
4,"After we located the stud and predrilled all the holes for the screws, this installed very securely and provides a good range of motion.  The one hiccup was the plate that attaches to the monitor - while it had all the screw holes in the right place for our monitor (Viewsonic 22""), one of its ""wings"" extended over and blocked the cord and DVI sockets on the back of the monitor. I had to do some judicious hacksaw work to provide access. This had no effect on the strength of the mount, since it was all past the screw holes. But be aware a little additional work may be necessary on your install."
5,"This is great!!  Works perfectly on the DROID Bionic!  After putting it in the phone for the first time I had to reformat the card.  The phone told me the card was damaged before reformatting.  Don't panic if you see that.  Just go in to your phone's settings, storage, SD Card, Unmount SD, and reformat that baby.  Now my phone has 80GB of total storage.  Less than that after formatting, but it's still a ton of space to put all of my music and movies.  Time to convert and load more movies now that I have 27GB left.  After formatting, the phone tells me the card has 59.46GB available.  If you notice on computer hard drives, the same thing happens.  A 250GB hard drive will only give you about 233GB that you can actually use.  It's normal.  I recommend this card to anyone who wants to leave their iPod at home and store all of their media on their phone, you can have everything with you wherever you go.  It's awesome!"
5,"In my opinion, this is the best e book.  I am so frustrated with the new version since they don't have sd card expansion although still prefer it over Kindle"
5,"This mount is excellent. It is very well built and sturdy. I used it to mount a 32"" TV and it fit the need perfectly. The price was also very good and much, much cheaper than what an inferior mount would cost in a retail store. I would definitely recommend."
5,"I swear by this!  You can put it any place on the wall and you get a swiveling TV with a very strong mount. I have bought 2 of these so far and will be buying more. Very heavy duty parts, easy to put together , easier with 2 people or 1 strong."
